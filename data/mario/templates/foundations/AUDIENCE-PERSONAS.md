## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

The company's best-fit customer at the organization level.

**Company type:** [e.g., B2B SaaS startups, DTC e-commerce brands, professional services firms]
**Size:** [e.g., 10-100 employees, $1M-$20M revenue, solo founders]
**Industry:** [e.g., technology, healthcare, education — or "industry-agnostic"]
**Stage:** [e.g., seed to Series B, established SMB, growth-stage]
**Geography:** [e.g., US-focused, global English-speaking, Europe]
**Budget range:** [e.g., $50-500/month, enterprise contracts, project-based]

**ICP Summary:** [One sentence describing the ideal customer: "Early-stage B2B SaaS companies with 10-50 employees who need to establish their marketing foundation without a dedicated marketing team."]

### Qualifying Signals

Signs that a prospect fits the ICP:

- [signal — e.g., actively hiring their first marketing role]
- [signal — e.g., recently raised funding and need to show growth]
- [signal — e.g., have a product but no consistent content or lead generation]
- [signal — e.g., current marketing is founder-led and ad hoc]

### Disqualifying Signals

Signs that a prospect is NOT a good fit:

- [signal — e.g., enterprise companies with 500+ employees and existing marketing teams]
- [signal — e.g., pre-product companies without a clear offering to market]
- [signal — e.g., companies in highly regulated industries requiring legal review of all content]

## Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)

What customers are "hiring" the product/service to do.

### Primary JTBD

**When** [situation or trigger],
**I want to** [action or capability],
**so I can** [desired outcome].

**Functional job:** [the practical task they need done]
**Emotional job:** [how they want to feel]
**Social job:** [how they want to be perceived]

### Secondary JTBD

**When** [situation],
**I want to** [action],
**so I can** [outcome].

### Related JTBD

| Job | Frequency | Current Solution | Satisfaction |
|-----|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| [job they're trying to do] | [how often] | [what they use now] | [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH] |
| [job] | [frequency] | [current solution] | [satisfaction] |
| [job] | [frequency] | [current solution] | [satisfaction] |

## Awareness Levels

Where prospects fall on the awareness spectrum, and what content they need at each level.

| Level | Description | Content Needed | Example |
|-------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| **Unaware** | Don't know they have a problem | [educational content, thought leadership about the problem space] | [example topic or headline] |
| **Problem-Aware** | Know the problem, don't know solutions exist | [content naming and validating the problem, introducing the solution category] | [example] |
| **Solution-Aware** | Know solutions exist, don't know about us | [comparison content, category education, brand awareness] | [example] |
| **Product-Aware** | Know about us, haven't decided | [case studies, demos, proof points, objection handling] | [example] |
| **Most Aware** | Know us well, need a reason to act now | [offers, urgency, social proof, risk reversal] | [example] |

### Audience Distribution (Estimated)

```
Unaware:        [XX%] ████████████
Problem-Aware:  [XX%] █████████████████
Solution-Aware: [XX%] ████████████████████

<guidelines>

**Ideal Customer Profile:**
- ICP is at the COMPANY level (for B2B) or SEGMENT level (for B2C). Personas are at the INDIVIDUAL level. Don't confuse them.
- Qualifying and disqualifying signals help the content team focus. Content for non-ICP prospects is wasted effort.
- If the company is B2C, adapt the ICP section to describe the ideal customer segment (demographics, psychographics, lifestyle) rather than company attributes.

**Buyer Personas:**
- 2-4 personas is ideal. Fewer than 2 means the audience isn't differentiated. More than 4 means the team can't remember them all.
- Give each persona a memorable name. Names make personas stick in team conversations.
- Pain points and objections should use the customer's actual language, not the company's interpretation. Pull from reviews, support tickets, and interview transcripts.
- Purchase triggers are critical for content timing — what happens that makes someone ready to act?
- Representative quotes should sound like something a real person would say, not marketing copy.

**Jobs to Be Done:**
- JTBD reveals WHY customers buy, not just WHO they are. A persona might match but have no job to hire the product for.
- The functional/emotional/social split helps writers address different motivations in content.
- "Current solution" in the related JTBD table reveals what the company actually competes with (often not direct competitors).

**Awareness Levels:**
- Most content strategies over-index on Problem-Aware and under-serve Product-Aware and Most Aware. Note the distribution.
- Content needed at each level should be specific enough to inspire actual content briefs.
- The audience distribution estimate doesn't need to be precise — it informs content mix priorities.

**Buyer Journey:**
- Map specific questions, not generic stages. "How do I get my team to actually adopt a PM tool?" is actionable. "Learning about solutions" is not.
- Content types should be specific: "2,000-word comparison guide" not "blog post."
- Channels should match where the persona actually is at each stage, not where the company wants them to be.

**Relationship to other foundations:**
- Personas inform MESSAGING-FRAMEWORK.md — messages per persona
- Pain points and objections feed MESSAGING-FRAMEWORK.md — objection handling
- Journey stages inform CHANNELS-DISTRIBUTION.md — content per channel per stage
- Awareness levels inform content creation priorities

**This document is permanent.** Every content piece should be written for a specific persona at a specific awareness level and journey stage. If the writer can't identify which, the persona definitions need more clarity.
