# Product / Service Template

```markdown
# Product / Service

**Company:** [company name]
**Researched:** [date]
**Source:** [website, product pages, pricing page, documentation, demos]

## Product Overview

## Features-to-Benefits Mapping

The raw material for all marketing copy. Features are what the product does; benefits are why customers care.

|---------|-------------|-----------------|---------|-------------------|
| [feature name] | [functional description] | [outcome the customer gets] | [which persona cares most] | [e.g., homepage hero, comparison page, onboarding email] |
| [feature] | [description] | [benefit] | [persona] | [content context] |
| [feature] | [description] | [benefit] | [persona] | [content context] |

### [Feature Category 2: e.g., Collaboration / Sharing]

|---------|-------------|-----------------|---------|-------------------|
| [feature] | [description] | [benefit] | [persona] | [content context] |
| [feature] | [description] | [benefit] | [persona] | [content context] |

### [Feature Category 4: e.g., Integrations / Platform]

| Feature | What It Does | Customer Benefit | Persona | Use In Content When |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|---------|-------------------|
| [feature] | [description] | [benefit] | [persona] | [content context] |
| [feature] | [description] | [benefit] | [persona] | [content context] |

## Social Proof Themes

Recurring themes from customer feedback that can be used across marketing content.

### Positive Themes

| Theme | Frequency | Representative Quotes | Best For |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|----------|
| [e.g., "Easy to get started"] | [how often this appears in reviews] | "[quote 1]" — [attribution]; "[quote 2]" — [attribution] | [content types — e.g., homepage, onboarding, ads] |
| [e.g., "Saves us hours every week"] | [frequency] | "[quote]" — [attribution] | [content types] |
| [e.g., "Team actually uses it"] | [frequency] | "[quote]" — [attribution] | [content types] |
| [e.g., "Great customer support"] | [frequency] | "[quote]" — [attribution] | [content types] |

### Negative Themes (Handle in Content)

| Theme | Frequency | How to Address |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| [e.g., "Needs more reporting"] | [frequency] | [how to acknowledge and handle — e.g., "roadmap mention, or emphasize simplicity as a feature"] |
| [e.g., "Mobile app is basic"] | [frequency] | [handling approach] |

### Review Site Presence

| Site | Rating | Review Count | Sentiment Trend |
|------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| [e.g., G2] | [rating] | [count] | [improving/stable/declining] |
| [e.g., Capterra] | [rating] | [count] | [trend] |
| [e.g., Product Hunt] | [rating/upvotes] | [count] | [trend] |

## Pricing Positioning

How pricing supports the overall brand positioning and marketing messaging.

### Pricing Model

**Model type:** [e.g., per-seat monthly, flat rate, usage-based, project-based, tiered]
**Price range:** [e.g., $29-199/month, custom enterprise pricing, $5,000 per project]
**Free tier/trial:** [e.g., 14-day free trial, freemium with limits, no free option]
**Billing:** [monthly/annual, discount for annual]

### Plan Tiers (if applicable)

| Plan | Price | Target Persona | Key Features | Positioning |
|------|-------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| [plan name] | [price] | [who this is for] | [what's included] | [how to position — e.g., "for getting started"] |
| [plan name] | [price] | [persona] | [features] | [positioning] |
| [plan name] | [price] | [persona] | [features] | [positioning] |

### Pricing Messaging

**Pricing narrative:** [How to talk about pricing — e.g., "fair and transparent," "invest in growth," "affordable for small teams"]
**Anchor point:** [What to compare price against — e.g., cost of alternatives, cost of the problem, hourly rate equivalent]
**Objection preemption:** [How to handle "too expensive" — e.g., ROI calculation, comparison to competitor pricing, value framing]

## Product Roadmap (Public)

<guidelines>

**Product Overview:**
- Write from the CUSTOMER's perspective, not the company's. "Helps small teams ship faster" not "A project management platform with Kanban boards."
- Include the delivery model and category — these ground all messaging.

**Features-to-Benefits Mapping:**
- This is the single most important section for content writers. EVERY feature must have a customer benefit.
- Benefits answer "so what?" — "Kanban boards" is a feature. "See your team's work at a glance" is the benefit.
- The "Use In Content When" column prevents generic feature listings. Writers know exactly where to use each feature-benefit pair.
- Categorize features as the company presents them, not how the product is engineered internally.
- If a feature lacks a clear customer benefit, it either needs reframing or shouldn't be prominently marketed.

**Use Cases:**
- Use cases are the bridge between features and content. Each use case can generate multiple content pieces.
- Be specific — "Agency managing 15 client projects" is better than "project management for agencies."
- The outcome should be measurable or at least observable. "Saved 5 hours/week" or "stopped losing projects to disorganization."
- Content opportunities help writers and the content planning process. What can this use case become?

**Social Proof Themes:**
- Themes, not individual reviews. Look for patterns across 10+ reviews.
- Positive themes become ad copy, testimonial sections, and content reinforcement.
- Negative themes need handling strategies — ignoring them doesn't make objections disappear.
- Review site presence informs whether to invest in review generation campaigns.

**Pricing Positioning:**
- Price is a marketing message, not just a number. How it's framed matters.
- The anchor point is critical — "$99/month" means nothing without context. "$99/month vs. $5,000 for an agency" reframes value.
- Plan tiers should map to personas. If they don't, the pricing page will confuse buyers.

**Product Roadmap:**
- Only include publicly announced items. Don't publish internal roadmaps.
- The marketing relevance column helps writers know when messaging will change.

**Relationship to other foundations:**
- Features-to-benefits mapping feeds MESSAGING-FRAMEWORK.md proof points
- Use cases feed content creation topics
- Social proof themes feed MESSAGING-FRAMEWORK.md testimonials and proof points
- Pricing positioning feeds MESSAGING-FRAMEWORK.md objection handling

**This document is permanent.** It's the source of truth for what the product does and how to talk about it. Update when the product ships significant changes.
