<guidelines>

**This is a SYNTHESIS, not a duplication.** The Brand Bible compresses 7 detailed foundation documents into one scannable reference. It should be:
- **Compact:** Fits in a single context load. No section should be more than a few paragraphs.
- **Actionable:** Every section tells a content creator something they can USE right now.
- **Self-contained:** A writer should be able to create good content using ONLY this document, even if the detailed foundations provide deeper context.
- **Scannable:** Tables, bullet points, and short entries. A writer looking for "how should our social media sound?" should find the answer in 5 seconds.

**Executive Summary:**
- This is the "briefing" for any new content session. 3-4 paragraphs that give full context.
- Write for someone who has never worked with this brand before. They should understand the brand after reading this section.

**Quick-Reference Voice Card:**
- Extract the essence from VOICE-TONE.md. Voice attributes + tone adjustments + language rules.
- The voice card should be enough for a writer to produce on-brand content without reading the full voice document.
- Keep it tight — a table, a few bullet points, and key dos/don'ts.

**Persona Summaries:**
- Compress each persona from AUDIENCE-PERSONAS.md into 6 lines.
- The "Objects" field with a representative quote is critical — writers need to hear the customer's voice.
- "Responds to" tells writers what KIND of content to create, not just what topic.

**Core Messages:**
- Extract from MESSAGING-FRAMEWORK.md. Core message + pillars + elevator pitch + boilerplate.
- The pillar table with "Best Proof Point" ensures messages are backed by evidence.

**Product Quick Reference:**
- Compress from PRODUCT-SERVICE.md. What it is, for whom, key benefits, pricing, top use cases.
- Benefits must be outcomes, not features. If a writer reads "real-time sync" instead of "your team always sees the latest work," the product reference has failed.

**Competitive Positioning:**
- Compress from COMPETITIVE-LANDSCAPE.md. One-sentence differentiators per competitor.
- "vs. Status quo" is critical — the biggest competitor is often inaction.
- "Our unique angle" is the positioning white space the company owns.

**Channel Overview:**
- Compress from CHANNELS-DISTRIBUTION.md. Priority order, content types, and cadence.
- The repurposing rule and growth model give strategic context in one sentence each.

**Content Creation Checklist:**
- This is the quality gate. Before any content goes out, check these boxes.
- Each item traces back to a foundation principle. If a writer can't check "Persona," the content isn't targeted enough.

**Design principle:** Think of the Brand Bible as the "cheat sheet" a freelance writer would need to produce great content on their first day. Everything essential, nothing extraneous.
