# Messaging Framework Template

Template for `.mario_planning/foundations/MESSAGING-FRAMEWORK.md` — the structured messaging system that ensures consistent, persuasive communication across all content. This is a permanent brand reference document loaded by every content creation session.

<template>

```markdown
# Messaging Framework

**Company:** [company name]
**Researched:** [date]
**Source:** [brand identity, audience research, competitive analysis]

## Core Message

The single most important message. If the audience remembers only one thing, it's this.

**Core message:** [One sentence. Specific, differentiated, customer-outcome focused. Not a tagline — a clear statement of value.]

**Tagline (if exists):** [Short, memorable brand tagline]

**Boilerplate (30 words):** [Standard company description for press releases, bios, and footers]

## Messaging Hierarchy

How messages layer from broad to specific.

```
Level 1: Core Message
    "We help [audience] [achieve outcome]"
    │
    ├── Level 2: Pillar Messages (3-4)
    │   ├── "[Pillar 1 — e.g., speed/efficiency benefit]"
    │   ├── "[Pillar 2 — e.g., quality/outcome benefit]"
    │   ├── "[Pillar 3 — e.g., ease/simplicity benefit]"
    │   └── "[Pillar 4 — e.g., cost/ROI benefit]"
    │
    └── Level 3: Proof Points (per pillar)
        ├── [metric, testimonial, case study]
        ├── [specific feature → benefit connection]
        └── [customer story or data point]
```

[Sentence 3: evidence or outcome that proves it works.]

### 60-Second Pitch (Full Context)

[For conference talks, podcast intros, detailed bios, investor conversations.]

[Paragraph — 4-5 sentences covering: audience problem, why existing solutions fail, what the company does differently, proof it works, and what's next or the vision.]

## Message-to-Channel Mapping

How core messages adapt across channels.

| Message | Website | Email | Social | Ads | Blog |
|---------|---------|-------|--------|-----|------|
| [Core message] | [how it appears on the homepage] | [how it appears in subject lines/headers] | [how it appears in posts] | [how it appears in ad copy] | [how it appears in article intros] |
| [Pillar 1] | [website adaptation] | [email adaptation] | [social adaptation] | [ad adaptation] | [blog adaptation] |
| [Pillar 2] | [website] | [email] | [social] | [ads] | [blog] |

<guidelines>

**Core Message:**
- The core message is NOT a tagline. It's a clear, specific statement of value. Taglines can be creative; the core message must be clear.
- Test: could a competitor say the same thing? If yes, it's not differentiated enough.
- Test: does it name the customer outcome? If not, it's feature-focused, not benefit-focused.
- The boilerplate is used everywhere (press releases, speaker bios, email signatures). Get it right and reuse forever.

**Messaging Hierarchy:**
- Level 1 (core message) appears everywhere. Level 2 (pillars) appear in campaigns and content. Level 3 (proof points) support claims.
- 3-4 pillars is ideal. Each pillar should address a different aspect of value. Together, they make the full case.
- Pillars should map to personas — different personas care about different pillars.

**Messages by Persona:**
- Pull directly from AUDIENCE-PERSONAS.md pain points and goals.
- Language cues are critical — writers should use the persona's vocabulary, not the company's.
- Emotional triggers help writers create content that motivates action, not just informs.

**Proof Points:**
- Organize by type so writers can quickly find what they need.
- Every message pillar should have at least one strong proof point. Pillars without proof are claims without credibility.
- Note gaps — missing proof points inform content strategy (e.g., need to collect more testimonials, publish case studies).

**Objection Handling:**
- Pull objections directly from AUDIENCE-PERSONAS.md.
- The "real concern" beneath each objection is what content should actually address.
- The acknowledge/reframe/prove framework works across channels — it adapts from sales conversations to landing page copy to email sequences.
- "In content, handle with" is the actionable output — tells writers HOW to preemptively address objections.

**Elevator Pitches:**
- Pre-written pitches save time and ensure consistency. Everyone describes the company the same way.
- The 10-second pitch is used most often. It must be memorable and clear.
- Test pitches out loud. If they sound written, they need to be more natural.

**Message-to-Channel Mapping:**
- The same message sounds different on LinkedIn vs. a landing page vs. an email subject line. This table shows how.
- Writers reference this when creating channel-specific content to stay on-message while adapting tone.

**Relationship to other foundations:**
- Depends on: BRAND-IDENTITY.md (positioning), AUDIENCE-PERSONAS.md (pain points, objections), COMPETITIVE-LANDSCAPE.md (differentiation)
- Feeds into: every piece of content created via /mario:create
- BRAND-BIBLE.md summarizes key messages from this document

**This document is permanent.** It's the messaging playbook. Every piece of content should trace back to a pillar message, target a specific persona, and use appropriate proof points.
