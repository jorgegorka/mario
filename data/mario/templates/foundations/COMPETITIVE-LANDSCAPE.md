## Messaging Analysis

How each competitor frames their value — what we can learn and where we should differentiate.

### Common Messaging Themes

Themes that appear across multiple competitors (table stakes messaging — saying this won't differentiate us):

| Theme | Used By | Our Approach |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| [e.g., "Save time"] | [Competitors A, B, C] | [how we handle this — match, ignore, or reframe] |
| [e.g., "Easy to use"] | [Competitors B, D] | [approach] |
| [e.g., "All-in-one"] | [Competitors A, C] | [approach] |

### Unique Messaging Angles

Distinctive angles individual competitors own:

| Competitor | Unique Angle | Effectiveness | Can We Counter? |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| [Competitor A] | [their unique claim or positioning angle] | [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW — based on market reception] | [how we can counter or differentiate] |
| [Competitor B] | [unique angle] | [effectiveness] | [our counter] |
| [Competitor C] | [unique angle] | [effectiveness] | [our counter] |

### Proof Point Comparison

What competitors use as evidence for their claims:

| Proof Type | Competitor A | Competitor B | Competitor C | Us |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Customer count | [metric] | [metric] | [metric] | [our metric] |
| Testimonials | [quality/quantity] | [quality/quantity] | [quality/quantity] | [ours] |
| Case studies | [count/quality] | [count/quality] | [count/quality] | [ours] |
| Industry recognition | [awards, press] | [awards, press] | [awards, press] | [ours] |
| Performance claims | [specific claims] | [claims] | [claims] | [ours] |

## Content & SEO Landscape

### Content Volume & Quality

| Competitor | Blog Posts | Publishing Frequency | Content Quality | SEO Investment |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|----------------|---------------|
| [Competitor A] | [estimated count] | [weekly/monthly] | [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] | [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] |
| [Competitor B] | [count] | [frequency] | [quality] | [investment] |
| [Competitor C] | [count] | [frequency] | [quality] | [investment] |

### Keyword Overlap

| Keyword/Topic Area | Competitor A | Competitor B | Us | Opportunity |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|-----|------------|
| [keyword area] | [ranking/presence] | [ranking/presence] | [our position] | [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] |
| [keyword area] | [ranking] | [ranking] | [position] | [opportunity] |
| [keyword area] | [ranking] | [ranking] | [position] | [opportunity] |

## Gaps & Opportunities

### Competitor Weaknesses We Can Exploit

| Weakness | Which Competitors | Our Opportunity |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| [weakness — e.g., poor content quality, stale blog] | [Competitor A, B] | [what we can do — e.g., own the educational content niche] |
| [weakness — e.g., confusing pricing, hidden costs] | [Competitor C] | [opportunity] |
| [weakness — e.g., no social proof, weak case studies] | [Competitor A, D] | [opportunity] |

### Underserved Audiences

| Audience Segment | Current Options | Why Underserved | Our Approach |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| [segment] | [what exists for them] | [why current options fail them] | [how we serve them better] |
| [segment] | [options] | [gap] | [approach] |

### Messaging White Space

Topics, angles, or positions that no competitor occupies:

- [White space — e.g., no competitor speaks directly to [persona] about [specific problem]]
- [White space — e.g., no competitor addresses [use case] in their content]
- [White space — e.g., the "[positioning angle]" position is unoccupied]

### Content Gaps

Topics where competitor content is weak or absent, representing SEO and thought leadership opportunities:

- [Gap — topic/keyword area with low competition and high audience relevance]
- [Gap — content format no competitor uses well]
- [Gap — audience question no competitor answers thoroughly]

## Sources

- [Competitor websites reviewed — list URLs]
- [Review sites — G2, Capterra, TrustRadius]
- [Ad transparency tools — Google Ads Transparency, Meta Ad Library]
- [SEO tools — if used for keyword/content analysis]

<guidelines>

**Competitor Selection:**
- Include 5-10 competitors across direct, indirect, and substitute categories.
- Direct competitors are obvious. Don't neglect indirect competitors and substitutes — these are often the real competition (spreadsheets, agencies, "doing nothing").
- Prioritize competitors the target audience actually considers, not the ones the company thinks about.

**Competitor Profiles:**
- Focus on what's observable and verifiable: website copy, pricing pages, public content, reviews.
- Messaging approach is critical — HOW competitors talk matters more than WHAT they offer. This directly informs our differentiation.
- Content strategy analysis reveals what competitors invest in and where they compete for attention.
- Use review sites (G2, Capterra) for honest strengths and weaknesses — marketing pages only show strengths.

**Positioning Matrix:**
- Choose dimensions that matter to BUYERS, not dimensions that flatter the company.
- 2-3 dimensions is enough. Common useful dimensions: simplicity vs. depth, price vs. premium, self-serve vs. high-touch, specialist vs. generalist.
- The goal is to reveal where the company has defensible positioning space.

**Messaging Analysis:**
- Common messaging themes = table stakes. Saying "easy to use" when everyone says it provides zero differentiation.
- Unique angles reveal what each competitor owns in the buyer's mind. The company needs its own unique angle.
- Proof point comparison reveals social proof gaps and opportunities.

**Gaps & Opportunities:**
- This is the most actionable section. Every gap should suggest a content or positioning action.
- Messaging white space = unclaimed territory. The company can own a position no one else occupies.
- Content gaps = SEO and thought leadership opportunities. Topics where competitors are absent or weak.

**Relationship to other foundations:**
- Competitor positioning informs BRAND-IDENTITY.md positioning and differentiators
- Competitor messaging informs MESSAGING-FRAMEWORK.md — what to avoid, what to counter
- Content gaps inform content creation priorities
- Underserved audiences may refine AUDIENCE-PERSONAS.md

**This document is permanent.** It provides competitive context for every content piece. When writing about a topic, check: what have competitors said? How can we be different and better?
