## Tone Spectrum

Tone is HOW we adjust our voice based on context. Voice stays the same; tone flexes.

```
More Formal ◄──────────────────────────────► More Casual

Legal/compliance    Website copy    Blog posts    Social media    Internal
   documents         & email       & articles      & chat         comms
```

### Tone by Context

**Website — Homepage & Landing Pages:**
[e.g., Confident and outcome-focused. Lead with the customer's problem. Short sentences. Clear value. Minimal jargon.]

**Website — Product/Feature Pages:**
[e.g., Specific and benefit-driven. Show, don't tell. Use concrete examples and outcomes. Okay to get slightly more detailed.]

**Blog Posts & Articles:**
[e.g., Conversational and educational. Write like a knowledgeable friend explaining something. Use "you" and "we." Include practical examples.]

**Email — Marketing & Newsletters:**
[e.g., Warm and direct. Short paragraphs. One clear purpose per email. Subject lines: curiosity or benefit, never clickbait.]

**Email — Transactional & Onboarding:**
[e.g., Helpful and concise. Tell them what happened and what to do next. No marketing fluff in transactional emails.]

**Social Media — [Primary Platform]:**
[e.g., Professional but personable. Share insights with clear takeaways. Engage in comments. No hashtag spam.]

**Social Media — [Secondary Platform]:**
[e.g., More casual and conversational. Quick tips, reactions, and observations. Okay to show personality.]

**Advertising — Paid Ads:**
[e.g., Punchy and benefit-driven. Every word earns its place. Lead with the outcome, not the feature.]

**Customer Support:**
[e.g., Patient, clear, and solution-focused. Step-by-step. Acknowledge the problem. No blame. Never condescending.]

**Sales & Outreach:**
[e.g., Respectful and value-first. No pushy tactics. Lead with relevant insight, not a pitch. Short emails.]

<guidelines>

**Voice Attributes:**
- Derive voice attributes from BRAND-IDENTITY.md personality attributes. They should align.
- Each attribute needs the full treatment: means, does not mean, do example, don't example. Without all four, writers will interpret attributes differently.
- 3-5 attributes is the target. Fewer than 3 lacks specificity. More than 5 is too many to remember.
- Attributes should be distinct from each other — don't overlap (e.g., "friendly" and "approachable" are too similar).
- Test attributes against the company's actual content. If existing content consistently violates an attribute, either the content needs to change or the attribute is wrong.

**Tone Spectrum:**
- Voice is constant; tone flexes by context. Make this distinction clear.
- The spectrum visual helps writers quickly calibrate. Where does this content type fall?
- Cover every major content context the company uses or plans to use.
- Be specific in tone descriptions — "professional" means nothing. "Confident and outcome-focused, short sentences, lead with the customer's problem" is actionable.

**Language Preferences:**
- Preferred terms should reflect customer language, not internal jargon.
- Product-specific terminology needs strict definitions — inconsistent product terminology confuses customers.
- Words to avoid should include WHY and WHAT TO USE INSTEAD. Just saying "avoid" without alternatives leaves writers stuck.

**Style Conventions:**
- Keep this section practical and scannable. Writers need to reference it quickly.
- Capitalization, punctuation, and number rules should cover the 80% case. Don't try to document every edge case.

**Do/Don't Examples:**
- This is the most valuable section for writers. More examples = better content.
- Examples should span different content types so writers see how voice applies everywhere.
- Show the same idea written well and poorly — contrast is the best teacher.
- Draw examples from actual content when possible, or create realistic ones.

**Relationship to other foundations:**
- Voice attributes flow from BRAND-IDENTITY.md personality
- Tone by context informs CHANNELS-DISTRIBUTION.md channel strategy
- Language preferences inform MESSAGING-FRAMEWORK.md message construction

**This document is permanent.** It's the primary reference for every piece of content created. Make it specific enough that two different writers would produce noticeably similar output.
