## Content Repurposing Flow

How a single piece of content gets adapted and distributed across channels.

```
[Pillar Content — e.g., Long-form blog post or guide]
    │
    ├── Email newsletter — [key takeaway + link]
    ├── LinkedIn post — [insight or quote + discussion prompt]
    ├── Twitter/X thread — [key points broken into thread]
    ├── Social graphic — [pull quote or statistic]
    ├── Ad creative — [headline variations from key benefits]
    └── Video/audio — [script or talking points from content]
```

### Repurposing Rules

- [e.g., Every blog post generates at least 3 social posts and 1 email mention]
- [e.g., Repurpose within 48 hours of publication to maximize reach]
- [e.g., Adapt format and tone for each channel — don't just copy/paste]
- [e.g., Track which repurposed formats drive the most engagement per channel]

## Channel Priority Ranking

| Rank | Channel | Investment Level | Expected Impact | Rationale |
|------|---------|-----------------|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | [channel] | [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW — time and money] | [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] | [why this is #1] |
| 2 | [channel] | [investment] | [impact] | [rationale] |
| 3 | [channel] | [investment] | [impact] | [rationale] |
| 4 | [channel] | [investment] | [impact] | [rationale] |

<guidelines>

**Channel Strategy:**
- The growth model determines channel priorities. Content-led = blog/SEO first. Product-led = onboarding/email first. Sales-led = LinkedIn/outbound first.
- "Be everywhere" is not a strategy. Companies with limited resources should go deep in 2-3 channels before expanding.
- The distribution philosophy should match the company's resources and stage.

**Channel Inventory:**
- Include active, planned, AND rejected channels. Documenting rejections prevents revisiting the same decision.
- "Audience fit" is the most important column. A channel with low audience fit shouldn't be a priority regardless of trendiness.
- Current state should be honest — "dormant blog with 5 posts from 2023" is useful information.

**Channel-Specific Considerations:**
- Every channel section must answer: what content types, what tone, what cadence, how it reaches the audience, and what we measure.
- Content types should be specific. "Blog posts" is too vague. "How-to guides (1,500-2,500 words) and comparison posts" is actionable.
- Tone adjustments reference VOICE-TONE.md. The voice is the same; the tone shifts per channel.
- Platform/tools ground the strategy in reality — you can't plan email marketing without knowing the ESP.

**Content Repurposing:**
- Repurposing is the highest-leverage content strategy for small teams. One piece of pillar content feeds multiple channels.
- The repurposing flow should be specific to this company's active channels.
- Repurposing rules prevent the common failure of creating great content and only publishing it once.

**Priority Ranking:**
- Forces a clear decision about where to invest time and money.
- Investment level considers both money (ads) and time (content creation, community management).
- Expected impact should be grounded in audience fit and current channel performance, not optimism.

**Relationship to other foundations:**
- Depends on: AUDIENCE-PERSONAS.md (where personas spend time), VOICE-TONE.md (tone per channel), COMPETITIVE-LANDSCAPE.md (competitor channel presence and gaps)
- Feeds: content creation via /mario:create — which channel is this content for?
- BRAND-BIBLE.md summarizes channel priorities from this document

**This document is permanent.** It tells content creators where to publish, how to adapt, and how to distribute. Every /mario:create session references this to understand channel context.
