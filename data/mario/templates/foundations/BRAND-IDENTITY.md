# Brand Identity

**Company:** [company name]
**Researched:** [date]
**Source:** [website URL, interviews, documents referenced]

## Company Story

### Origin

[How and why the company was founded. What problem did the founders see? What motivated them to build this? 2-3 paragraphs capturing the authentic narrative.]

### Where We Are Now

[Current state of the company — stage, size, traction, key milestones. What has been proven? What is the company known for today?]

### Where We're Going

[Vision for the future. What does the world look like if this company succeeds? What is the ambitious outcome?]

## Mission, Vision & Values

**Mission** (what we do):
[One sentence. Present tense. What the company does and for whom.]

**Vision** (where we're going):
[One sentence. Future tense. The world the company is building toward.]

**Values** (how we operate):

| Value | What It Means | How It Shows Up |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| [value] | [definition in plain language] | [observable behavior — in product, content, customer interactions] |
| [value] | [definition] | [observable behavior] |
| [value] | [definition] | [observable behavior] |
| [value] | [definition] | [observable behavior] |

## Value Proposition

### Core Value Proposition

[One sentence that answers: "Why should someone choose us?" This is the single most important message. It should be specific, differentiated, and customer-outcome focused.]

### Supporting Value Props

| Value Prop | For Whom | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| [specific benefit] | [which persona or segment] | [proof — data, testimonial theme, case study] |
| [specific benefit] | [which persona or segment] | [proof] |
| [specific benefit] | [which persona or segment] | [proof] |

### Value Proposition Formula

**For** [target customer]
**who** [need or pain point],
**[product/company]** is a [category]
**that** [key benefit].
**Unlike** [primary alternative],
**we** [key differentiator].

## Competitive Positioning

### Category

[What category does the company compete in? How does it describe itself? If creating a new category, what is the adjacent category customers currently use?]

### Positioning Statement

[How the company positions itself relative to alternatives. Not about being better — about being different. What unique space does this company occupy?]

### Positioning Map

```
                        [Dimension A: e.g., Simple ←→ Complex]
                              ↑
                              |
        [Competitor A]        |        [Competitor B]
                              |
[Dimension B: e.g.,  --------+--------
Affordable ←→ Premium]       |
                              |
              [US]            |        [Competitor C]
                              |
                              ↓
```

### Key Differentiators

| Differentiator | Why It Matters | Competitors' Approach |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| [what makes us different] | [customer outcome this enables] | [how competitors handle this instead] |
| [differentiator] | [customer impact] | [competitor approach] |
| [differentiator] | [customer impact] | [competitor approach] |

## Brand Personality

### Personality Attributes

[3-5 attributes that describe how the brand feels as a "person." These inform voice, tone, visual design, and customer interactions.]

**[Attribute 1]:**
- Means: [what this looks like in practice]
- Does not mean: [common misinterpretation to avoid]
- Example: [how this shows up in content or customer interaction]

**[Attribute 2]:**
- Means: [what this looks like]
- Does not mean: [what to avoid]
- Example: [how it shows up]

**[Attribute 3]:**
- Means: [what this looks like]
- Does not mean: [what to avoid]
- Example: [how it shows up]

**[Attribute 4]:**
- Means: [what this looks like]
- Does not mean: [what to avoid]
- Example: [how it shows up]

### Brand Archetype

[If applicable — the dominant archetype that captures the brand's role in the customer's story. E.g., "The Guide" (helps customers succeed), "The Creator" (empowers people to build), "The Rebel" (challenges the status quo).]

**Archetype:** [archetype name]
**Role in customer's story:** [what role the brand plays]
**Narrative tension:** [what the brand stands against]

## Brand Proof Points

Evidence that substantiates the brand's claims and positioning.

| Claim | Proof | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| [what we claim] | [evidence — metric, testimonial, case study, award] | [where this comes from] |
| [claim] | [proof] | [source] |
| [claim] | [proof] | [source] |
| [claim] | [proof] | [source] |

<guidelines>

**Company Story:**
- Extract the authentic narrative, not marketing fluff. Look at the about page, founder interviews, press releases, and early blog posts.
- If the company doesn't have a published origin story, construct one from available context (PROJECT.md, website copy, user-provided information).
- The story should be usable in content — something a writer can reference when creating "about us" sections, founder bios, or brand narratives.

**Mission, Vision & Values:**
- Mission = what the company does NOW. Vision = what the company is building TOWARD. Don't confuse them.
- Values should be observable, not aspirational platitudes. "We ship fast" is observable. "Excellence" is not.
- If the company doesn't have stated values, infer them from behavior — how does the product work? What does the pricing say? What do customer interactions reveal?

**Value Proposition:**
- The core value prop should pass the "so what?" test. If a competitor could say the same thing, it's not differentiated enough.
- Supporting value props should map to specific personas — different customers care about different benefits.
- The formula format (For/who/is a/that/Unlike/we) forces clarity. Fill it in even if the result is imperfect.

**Competitive Positioning:**
- Position on dimensions that matter to customers, not dimensions that matter to the company.
- The positioning map should reveal white space — where is the company positioned that competitors are not?
- Differentiators must be real and defensible, not aspirational. "Better customer support" is only a differentiator if there's evidence.

**Brand Personality:**
- Personality attributes directly feed into VOICE-TONE.md. Get these right and voice follows naturally.
- Use the "means / does not mean" format to prevent misinterpretation. "Friendly" can mean very different things to different writers.
- The brand archetype is optional but useful for giving writers a mental model of the brand's role.

**Brand Proof Points:**
- Every major claim needs evidence. Extract from testimonials, case studies, metrics, awards, press mentions.
- If proof points are weak or missing, note this — it informs content strategy (need to build social proof).

**This document is permanent.** It gets loaded as context for every content creation session via BRAND-BIBLE.md. Accuracy and specificity matter more than comprehensiveness. Better to have 3 well-researched differentiators than 10 vague ones.
