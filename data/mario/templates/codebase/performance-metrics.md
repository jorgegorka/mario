## Analytics Setup

**Web Analytics:**
- Tool: Google Analytics 4
- Key events: newsletter_signup, lead_magnet_download, trial_start, purchase, demo_request
- Goals: Trial start (primary), email signup (secondary), demo request (secondary)
- Enhanced measurement: Scroll depth, outbound clicks, site search

**Email Analytics:**
- Tool: ConvertKit native analytics + UTM parameters on all links
- Tracked: Opens, clicks, sequence completion rates, tag-based conversion tracking
- Attribution: UTM links connect email clicks to GA4 conversion events

**Ad Platform Analytics:**
- Google Ads: Conversion tracking pixel installed, tracking trial_start and purchase events
- LinkedIn Ads: Insight Tag installed, tracking trial_start event
- Attribution window: 30-day click, 7-day view

**CRM Tracking:**
- Tool: HubSpot CRM (Free)
- Tracked: Lead source (from UTM first-touch), lifecycle stage (subscriber > lead > trial > customer > churned), deal value, close date

- Executive summary: Notion page, leadership, updated monthly
- Ad performance: Native platform dashboards, marketing lead, reviewed bi-weekly

## Tracking Gaps

**Not Currently Tracked:**
- Multi-touch attribution: Only first-touch captured. Need to understand full journey. Requires: HubSpot Marketing Hub upgrade or dedicated attribution tool.
- Content-level revenue attribution: Can't tie specific blog posts to revenue. Need: Enhanced UTM tracking through full funnel + CRM integration.
- Dark social/word-of-mouth: 22% of signups self-report referral but no tracking of which referrer. Need: Referral tracking system.

**Partially Tracked:**
- Social media ROI: Track engagement and follower growth but not conversion from social to trial/purchase. Gap: Need consistent UTM tagging on all social links.
- Email revenue: Track email-to-trial but not trial-to-paid by email source. Gap: Need CRM lifecycle stage updates connected to email tags.

**Data Quality Issues:**
- Direct/None traffic in GA4: 15% of traffic shows as "direct" but likely includes dark social, untagged email links, and bookmark traffic. Inflates direct channel attribution.
- Duplicate contacts in CRM: Approximately 800 duplicate contacts from form submissions with different emails. Affects list size accuracy and segmentation.
- Ad conversion tracking delay: LinkedIn Insight Tag occasionally misses conversions due to ad blockers. Estimated 10-15% under-reporting on LinkedIn ad conversions.
