# Audience Insights

**Audit Date:** 2025-06-15

## Customer Segments

**Primary Segment:**
- Name: Small agency owners
- Description: Founders or principals of creative/marketing agencies with 5-25 employees
- Size: 60% of customer base (approximately 450 of 750 paying customers)
- Revenue contribution: 55% of MRR
- Key needs: Client project visibility, team workload management, simple time tracking
- Channels: LinkedIn (professional groups), industry blogs, podcast listeners, Google search for "agency project management"

**Secondary Segment:**
- Name: Startup operations leads
- Description: Operations managers or COOs at seed-to-Series-A startups (10-50 employees)
- Size: 25% of customer base
- Revenue contribution: 30% of MRR (higher average plan due to more seats)
- Key needs: Cross-team visibility, lightweight process without overhead, fast onboarding
- Channels: Product Hunt, tech Twitter, Hacker News, founder communities (Indie Hackers, private Slack groups)

**Tertiary Segment:**
- Name: Freelance consultants
- Description: Solo consultants managing multiple client engagements simultaneously
- Size: 15% of customer base
- Key needs: Client-facing project views, proposal tracking, minimal complexity

## Buyer Personas

**"Agency Alex" (Primary):**
- Role: Agency owner or managing director
- Company: Creative/digital agency, 8-20 employees, $500K-$3M revenue
- Goals: Spend less time on project admin, more on client work. See team capacity at a glance. Deliver projects on time without micromanaging.
- Pain points: Using 4+ tools for project management (spreadsheets, Slack, email, a PM tool nobody updates). No single source of truth. Loses 5+ hours/week on status meetings and check-ins.
- Objections: "We've tried 3 PM tools already, nobody uses them after month 2." "My team is allergic to process." "Can't justify another subscription."
- Decision factors: Speed of setup (<30 minutes), team adoption rate, client-facing views, price per seat
- Information sources: Agency-focused podcasts (Bureau of Digital, Agencies Drinking Beer), LinkedIn agency groups, peer recommendations
- Quote: "I don't need another project management tool. I need my team to actually use one."

**"Startup Sam" (Secondary):**
- Role: Head of Operations or COO
- Company: Seed/Series A startup, 15-40 employees, building operational foundation
- Goals: Establish lightweight processes before the team outgrows chaos. Cross-functional visibility without heavy tooling.
- Pain points: Team has outgrown Notion/spreadsheets but isn't ready for Jira/Asana complexity. Engineers resist "process." Each team uses different tools.
- Objections: "We're too early for a PM tool." "Will this scale as we grow?" "My engineers won't use anything that feels enterprise-y."
- Decision factors: Simplicity, developer-friendly (API, integrations), affordable at startup pricing, doesn't feel like "corporate overhead"
- Information sources: Hacker News, tech Twitter, Product Hunt, YC community, peer startup founders
- Quote: "We need just enough structure to stop dropping balls, without slowing anyone down."

## Engagement Patterns

**Content Preferences:**
- How-to and template content gets 3x more traffic than thought leadership pieces
- Case studies with specific metrics (e.g., "how Agency X reduced project overruns by 40%") convert at 4x generic product content
- Long-form blog posts (1500+ words) get 2.5x more organic traffic than short posts
- Listicles ("7 ways to...") get highest social shares but lowest conversion

**Channel Behavior:**
- LinkedIn: Engages with practical tips, data-driven insights, and founder stories. Ignores promotional posts. Comments drive reach.
- Email: Opens newsletters with specific, curiosity-driven subject lines. Ignores generic "monthly update" format. Clicks on one clear CTA, not multiple.
- Blog: Enters via search (70%), reads one article, bounces. Returning visitors read 2.5 articles per session and convert at 5x rate.
- Twitter/X: Quick engagement with hot takes and tips. Threads get saved/bookmarked more than single tweets.

**Timing Patterns:**
- Email opens peak Tuesday-Thursday 9:00-10:30am (recipient's local time)
- Blog traffic highest Monday-Wednesday mornings
- LinkedIn engagement peaks Tuesday and Thursday, lunch hours (12-1pm)
- Trial signups peak mid-week (Wednesday has 20% more signups than Monday)

**Device Usage:**
- Website: 68% desktop, 32% mobile (B2B audience browses at work)
- Email: 55% mobile, 45% desktop (read on commute/breaks)
- Social: 70% mobile

## Conversion Data

**Top Acquisition Channels:**
- Organic search: 40% of trials, 3.2% visitor-to-trial conversion
- Direct/referral: 25% of trials (word of mouth), 8% conversion rate
- LinkedIn (organic + ads): 18% of trials, 2.1% conversion
- Product Hunt/review sites: 10% of trials (spiky, campaign-driven)
- Other paid: 7% of trials, 1.5% conversion

**Conversion Triggers:**
- Highest converting path: Comparison page -> Pricing -> Trial signup (12% conversion)
- Second highest: Case study -> Features page -> Trial signup (8% conversion)
- Email lead magnet -> Nurture sequence -> Trial CTA (5% conversion over 14 days)

**Sales Cycle:**
- Average: 8 days from first website visit to trial start
- Trial to paid: 18 days average (14-day trial + 4 days of follow-up emails)
- Touchpoints: Average 5 content interactions before trial, 3 emails during trial
- Critical moment: Day 2-3 of trial -- users who complete onboarding checklist by day 3 convert at 22% vs. 3% for those who don't

## Customer Feedback Themes

**Positive Themes:**
- "Finally a tool my team actually uses" (mentioned in 35% of positive reviews)
- "Setup was incredibly fast" (28% of positive reviews)
- "Perfect amount of features -- not bloated" (22% of positive reviews)
- "Client-facing views saved us hours of reporting" (agency segment specific, 15%)

**Negative Themes:**
- "Needs better reporting/analytics" (most requested category, 40% of feature requests)
- "Mobile app is limited" (25% of negative feedback)
- "No Gantt chart view" (20% of negative feedback, mostly startup segment)
- "Integrations with [specific tool] missing" (15%, fragmented across many tools)

**Feature Requests:**
- Advanced reporting and dashboards: High frequency, requested by both segments
- Native mobile app improvements: Medium frequency, mostly startup segment
- Gantt/timeline view: Medium frequency, agency and startup segments equally
- Custom fields: Medium frequency, agency segment primarily

**Sources:**
- Support tickets: 200/month (analyzed quarterly for themes)
- NPS surveys: Quarterly (current NPS: 52, sample size: 180)
- G2 reviews: 45 total (4.6/5 average)
- Intercom chat transcripts: Reviewed monthly for common questions
- Churned customer interviews: 5-8/month (conducted by founder)

## Competitive Audience

**Competitor Audience Differences:**
- Asana: Targets mid-market and enterprise teams (50-500). More process-heavy users who want workflow automation. Higher willingness to pay, longer sales cycles.
- Monday.com: Broader audience including non-tech teams (HR, marketing, ops). More visual/spreadsheet-adjacent users. Larger marketing budget creates brand awareness advantage.
- Basecamp: Overlaps most with our audience -- small teams, simplicity-focused. Their audience skews slightly toward remote-first companies and values anti-enterprise philosophy.
- Linear: Developer-focused. Minimal audience overlap except at technical startups where engineering drives tool selection.

**Audience Overlap:**
- Share audience with Basecamp on "simple project management" keywords
- Share audience with Monday.com on "agency project management" keywords
- Our audience is more technical and process-averse than Monday.com's

**Switching Triggers:**
- From Asana/Monday: "Too complex for our small team, paying for features we don't use"
- From Basecamp: "Need more structure than flat to-do lists, want better client-facing views"
- From Notion: "Outgrew Notion for project management, need dedicated PM features"
- Customers leave us for Asana/Monday when: "Team grows past 30 and needs enterprise features (SSO, advanced permissions, audit logs)"
