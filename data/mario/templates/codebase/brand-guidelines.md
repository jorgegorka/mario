# Brand Guidelines

**Audit Date:** 2025-06-15

## Voice Attributes

**Knowledgeable:**
- Means: We know our subject deeply and share insights generously. We reference data, trends, and experience naturally.
- Does not mean: Lecturing, condescending, or using jargon to sound smart.
- Example: "Teams that batch similar tasks together typically see a 20-30% reduction in context-switching costs."

**Direct:**
- Means: We get to the point. We say what we mean without hedging or filler. We respect the reader's time.
- Does not mean: Blunt, cold, or lacking empathy. We're direct AND warm.
- Example: "Your project timeline is slipping. Here are three ways to get it back on track." (Not: "It might be worth considering whether perhaps the timeline could potentially benefit from some adjustments.")

**Approachable:**
- Means: We use plain language. We write like a helpful colleague, not a textbook. First person ("we") and second person ("you") are standard.
- Does not mean: Unprofessional, slangy, or trying too hard to be casual.
- Example: "Let's walk through how to set up your first workflow." (Not: "The following section delineates the workflow configuration process.")

**Confident:**
- Means: We stand behind our recommendations. We use definitive language when we have the evidence.
- Does not mean: Arrogant or dismissive of alternatives. We acknowledge tradeoffs.
- Example: "This approach works best for teams under 20 people." (Not: "This approach might possibly work for some teams in certain situations.")

## Tone by Context

**Blog posts:** Conversational and educational. Use "you" and "we" freely. Include practical examples. Okay to express opinions backed by experience. Aim for the tone of a smart colleague explaining something over coffee.

**Email marketing:** Warm and direct. Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences each). One clear CTA per email. Subject lines: curiosity or benefit-driven, no clickbait. Use the subscriber's first name.

**Social media (LinkedIn):** Professional but personable. Founder posts can be more informal and opinionated. Company posts are insight-driven with clear takeaways. No hashtag spam (max 3).

**Social media (Twitter/X):** Concise and punchy. Okay to be more casual. Share quick tips, reactions to industry news, customer wins. Threads for longer insights.

**Sales pages:** Confident and outcome-focused. Lead with the customer's problem, then the solution. Use specific numbers and customer quotes. Avoid superlatives without proof.

**Help documentation:** Clear, patient, and thorough. Step-by-step with screenshots. Define any technical terms. "Click the blue Save button in the top right corner" not "Save your changes."

## Terminology

**Preferred Terms:**
- "Workspace" instead of "project space" or "environment": Consistent with in-app terminology
- "Team members" instead of "users" or "seats": Humanizes the language
- "Workflow" instead of "process" or "pipeline": Our specific feature name
- "Connect" instead of "integrate" or "sync": Simpler, more approachable

**Product-Specific Terms:**
- Workspace: A shared space where a team organizes their work. Always lowercase unless starting a sentence.
- Dashboard: The main overview screen showing key metrics. Lowercase.
- Workflow: An automated sequence of steps. Our named feature -- capitalize only when referring to the feature name in product context.

**Words to Avoid:**
- "Synergy" / "leverage" / "paradigm": Corporate jargon that adds no meaning
- "Simple" / "easy" / "just": Minimizes the user's experience -- what's easy for us may not be for them
- "Best-in-class" / "world-class" / "cutting-edge": Empty superlatives without proof
- "Users": Say "team members", "customers", or "people" instead

**Jargon Policy:**
- Default to plain language. If a simpler word exists, use it.
- Define acronyms on first use in every piece: "Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)"
- Mirror the language customers use in support tickets and reviews, not internal product terminology
- Technical terms are fine in developer-focused content but should be explained in general-audience content

## Style Guide

**Capitalization:**
- Sentence case for all headings and titles: "How to set up your first workflow"
- Product name: Always "TaskFlow" (one word, capital T and F)
- Feature names in lowercase: "the dashboard", "workflows", "reports"
- Job titles lowercase unless before a name: "the CEO" but "CEO Maria Chen"

**Punctuation:**
- Oxford comma: always ("red, white, and blue")
- Em dashes with spaces: "The result -- a 30% increase -- surprised everyone"
- Exclamation marks: maximum one per email or blog post. Never in headings.
- Ellipsis: avoid. Use em dashes or break into separate sentences.

**Formatting:**
- Paragraphs: 2-3 sentences max for web and email. Longer is okay for in-depth blog posts.
- Lists: Bullet points for 3+ items. Numbered lists only for sequential steps.
- Bold for emphasis. No ALL CAPS. Italics only for titles of external works.
- Subheadings every 200-300 words in blog posts for scannability.

**Numbers:**
- Spell out one through nine, numerals for 10+
- Always numerals for: percentages (5%), money ($10), dates, times, and measurements
- Commas in numbers over 999: "1,000" not "1000"
- Avoid starting sentences with numerals. Rewrite or spell out.

**Typography:**
- Headings: Inter (bold, semi-bold)
