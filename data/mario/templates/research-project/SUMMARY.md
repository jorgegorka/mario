### Critical Pitfalls

[Top 5-7 from PITFALLS.md — marketing-specific risks identified through research]

3. **[Missing buyer journey content]** — [how to avoid — e.g., map content to funnel stages, audit gaps before creating new content]

## Implications for Roadmap

Based on research, suggested phase structure for this marketing project:

### Phase 1: Foundation — Audience Research, Brand Positioning & Voice
**Rationale:** [why this comes first — e.g., all content depends on knowing the audience and having clear positioning; brand voice consistency requires documentation before content creation]
**Delivers:** [what this phase produces — e.g., buyer personas, positioning statement, messaging hierarchy, brand voice guide, competitive analysis]
**Addresses:** [assets from research — e.g., audience definition, competitive differentiation]
**Avoids:** [pitfall from PITFALLS.md — e.g., inconsistent voice by establishing guidelines early, feature-focused copy by completing customer research first]
**Stack elements:** [from STACK.md — e.g., analytics setup, CRM configuration, brand asset creation]

### Phase 2: Web Content — Homepage, Landing Pages & Conversion Copy
**Rationale:** [why this order — e.g., website is the hub all other channels drive to; with positioning stable, build the conversion-optimized web presence]
**Delivers:** [what this phase produces — e.g., homepage copy, landing pages, feature pages, comparison pages, pricing page copy, CTA optimization]
**Addresses:** [assets from research — e.g., primary conversion paths, key landing pages]
**Uses:** [stack elements from STACK.md — e.g., CMS, analytics, A/B testing tools]
**Implements:** [architecture component — e.g., website content layer, conversion funnel]

### Phase 3: Email Marketing — Sequences, Automation & List Building
**Rationale:** [why this order — e.g., web content establishes the conversion points; email captures and nurtures leads from those points]
**Delivers:** [what this phase produces — e.g., welcome sequence, nurture flows, re-engagement series, lead magnets, list segmentation]
**Addresses:** [assets from research — e.g., subscriber onboarding, lead nurture, retention emails]
**Uses:** [stack elements from STACK.md — e.g., email service provider, automation platform, lead capture forms]
**Avoids:** [pitfall from PITFALLS.md — e.g., deliverability issues by authenticating domain first, compliance gaps by building opt-in properly]

### Phase 4: Content & Distribution — Blog, SEO, Social & Promotion
**Rationale:** [why this order — e.g., with conversion infrastructure in place, drive traffic through content marketing and social channels]
**Delivers:** [what this phase produces — e.g., blog content calendar, SEO-optimized articles, social media content, distribution workflows, content repurposing system]
**Addresses:** [assets from research — e.g., organic traffic growth, social presence, content library]
**Uses:** [stack elements from STACK.md — e.g., SEO tools, social scheduling, content management]
**Avoids:** [pitfall from PITFALLS.md — e.g., content without distribution by planning promotion alongside creation]

[Continue for additional phases if needed...]

### Phase Ordering Rationale

- [Why audience research and positioning come first — e.g., all content flows from audience understanding and brand positioning; without these, content is guesswork]
- [Why web content before email — e.g., email drives to the website; website must be ready to convert before driving traffic to it]
- [Why content and distribution are last — e.g., ongoing content creation benefits from established brand voice, proven messaging, and functioning conversion paths]
- [How this avoids pitfalls from research — e.g., early brand voice documentation prevents inconsistency; measurement setup in phase 1 means all subsequent phases have data]

### Research Flags

Phases likely needing deeper research during planning:
- **Phase [X]:** [reason — e.g., "competitor messaging landscape needs detailed analysis before positioning"]
- **Phase [Y]:** [reason — e.g., "email automation complexity depends on CRM capabilities and list size"]
- **Phase [Z]:** [reason — e.g., "SEO keyword landscape research needed before content calendar"]

Phases with standard marketing patterns (skip research-phase):
- **Phase [X]:** [reason — e.g., "standard email welcome sequence, well-documented best practices"]
- **Phase [Y]:** [reason — e.g., "social media content follows established platform playbooks"]

## Confidence Assessment

| Area | Confidence | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Stack | [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] | [reason — e.g., "established tools with clear use cases"] |
| Audience | [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] | [reason — e.g., "ICP defined but personas need validation with customer interviews"] |
| Architecture | [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] | [reason — e.g., "standard content architecture, but channel priorities need validation"] |
| Pitfalls | [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] | [reason — e.g., "common marketing pitfalls well-documented, project-specific risks less certain"] |

**Overall confidence:** [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

### Gaps to Address

[Any areas where research was inconclusive or needs validation during implementation]

- [Gap]: [how to handle during planning/execution — e.g., "audience size and behavior unknown, affects channel selection and budget allocation"]
- [Gap]: [how to handle during planning/execution — e.g., "competitor ad spend data unavailable, affects paid strategy"]
- [Gap]: [how to handle during planning/execution — e.g., "content production capacity unclear, affects publishing cadence commitments"]

## Sources

- [Industry benchmarks and reports] — [topics covered]
- [Platform documentation and best practices] — [topics]
- [Customer interview data or surveys] — [what was checked]

### Secondary (MEDIUM confidence)
