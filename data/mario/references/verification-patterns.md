# Verification Patterns

How to verify different types of marketing content are real deliverables, not drafts or placeholders.

<core_principle>
**Existence does not equal Quality**

A file existing does not mean the content is ready. Verification must check:
1. **Exists** - Deliverable is present in expected format
2. **Substantive** - Content is real, not placeholder or filler
3. **Aligned** - Consistent with strategy, brand voice, and audience
4. **Effective** - Actually communicates the intended message

Levels 1-3 can be checked systematically. Level 4 often requires human verification.
</core_principle>

<placeholder_detection>

## Universal Placeholder Patterns

These patterns indicate incomplete content regardless of deliverable type:

**Placeholder text:**
- "Lorem ipsum" or generic filler text
- "[Insert X here]" or "{company name}" template brackets left in
- "TBD", "TK", "Coming soon", "Will be updated"
- "TODO", "FIXME", "PLACEHOLDER"
- "Sample text", "Example copy", "Draft copy here"

**Generic or hollow content:**
- Value propositions that could apply to any product ("best in class", "innovative solution")
- CTAs that say "Click here" or "Learn more" without specificity
- Headlines that describe the section instead of communicating value ("Our Features", "About Us")
- Testimonials with fake names or "[Customer Name]" placeholders

**Missing elements:**
- Sections with headers but no body content
- Content outlines presented as finished deliverables
- Bullet points that list topics without developing them
- Metadata fields left empty (meta descriptions, alt text, subject lines)

</placeholder_detection>

<content_quality>

## Content Quality Checks

**Brand Voice Alignment:**
- Does the copy follow the established brand voice guidelines?
- Is the tone appropriate for the target persona and funnel stage?
- Does language complexity match the audience (technical vs. general)?
- Are brand-specific terms and phrasing used consistently?
- Does the content avoid language explicitly prohibited in brand guidelines?

**Substantive check:**
- Does the opening section communicate the value proposition?
- Are claims supported with specifics (data, examples, proof points)?
- Is the content original and specific to the product/service, not generic?
- Does the content address the target persona's pain points directly?
- Is the word count appropriate for the content type and channel?

**Placeholder patterns specific to marketing copy:**
```
RED FLAGS - These are not finished content:

"We offer innovative solutions for modern businesses"
  -> Generic, could be any company

"Our product helps you save time and money"
  -> No specifics, no proof points

"Click here to learn more"
  -> Vague CTA, no value proposition

"[Company] is the leading provider of [category]"
  -> Template brackets, unsubstantiated claim

"Dear [First Name], we wanted to reach out..."
  -> Merge tags without actual personalization strategy
```

</content_quality>

<cta_verification>

## CTA Verification

**Existence check:**
- Is at least one CTA present in the content?
- Is there a primary CTA that stands out from secondary actions?
- Is the CTA positioned appropriately (above fold, after value prop, end of content)?

**Substantive check:**
- Does the CTA communicate a specific action and benefit?
- Is the CTA language action-oriented (starts with a verb)?
- Does the CTA match the funnel stage (awareness: "Learn", consideration: "Compare", decision: "Start")?
- Is there urgency or specificity where appropriate?

**Alignment check:**
- Does the CTA align with the campaign's overall conversion goal?
- Does the CTA destination match what the copy promises?
- Are CTAs consistent across related content pieces?

**Placeholder patterns specific to CTAs:**
```
RED FLAGS - These need refinement:

"Click here"
  -> No value communicated

"Submit"
  -> Generic form button, not persuasive

"Learn more"
  -> Acceptable for awareness stage, but lacks specificity

"Buy now" on awareness-stage content
  -> Misaligned with funnel stage

"Sign up for our newsletter"
  -> No benefit stated for the reader
```

## Consistency Checks

Verify alignment across all deliverables in a plan or campaign.

### Voice Consistency
- Does every deliverable sound like it comes from the same brand?
- Is the level of formality consistent across channels?
- Are humor, metaphors, and stylistic choices applied uniformly?
- Does the voice shift appropriately for different funnel stages while remaining recognizably the same brand?

### Message Consistency
- Are key messages repeated across channels without contradiction?
- Is the value proposition stated the same way in all customer-facing content?
- Do statistics and claims match across all deliverables?
- Are product names, features, and descriptions identical everywhere?

### CTA Consistency
- Do CTAs across channels support the same campaign goal?
- Is the primary conversion action consistent (e.g., all paths lead to the same landing page)?
- Are CTA labels using the same language across touchpoints?

### Terminology Consistency
- Are product names capitalized and formatted the same way?
- Are industry terms used consistently (not mixing synonyms)?
- Is the brand name always presented in the correct format?
- Are competitor references handled uniformly?

**Red flags for inconsistency:**
```
INCONSISTENCY PATTERNS:

Homepage says "AI-powered analytics platform"
Email says "machine learning dashboard tool"
  -> Product description mismatch

Landing page CTA: "Start free trial"
Email CTA: "Get started today"
Ad CTA: "Try it free"
  -> Inconsistent but not necessarily wrong; verify this is intentional

Blog says "serving 10,000+ customers"
About page says "trusted by 8,500 businesses"
  -> Contradictory claims, must be reconciled

Some pages use "Sign up" while others use "Sign Up"
  -> Capitalization inconsistency
```

</consistency_checks>

<seo_checks>

**Placeholder patterns specific to SEO:**
```
RED FLAGS:

Meta description: "Welcome to our website"
  -> Generic, no keyword, no value proposition

Alt text: "image1.jpg" or "photo"
  -> Non-descriptive, wastes SEO opportunity

Title: "Blog Post Title | Company Name"
  -> Placeholder title left in

URL: /page-1 or /untitled
  -> Non-descriptive slug
```

## Systematic Verification Approach

For the verification agent, use this pattern:

**1. Check existence:**
- Confirm all expected deliverables for the plan are present
- Verify all required sections within each deliverable exist
- Check that metadata fields are populated

**2. Check for placeholder patterns:**
- Scan for template brackets: `[text]`, `{text}`, `<text>`
- Scan for placeholder markers: "TBD", "TK", "TODO", "Lorem ipsum"
- Scan for generic copy that could apply to any brand
- Flag any section with fewer than 2 sentences (potential stub)

**3. Check alignment:**
- Compare CTAs across deliverables for consistency
- Compare product descriptions across deliverables for consistency
- Verify key messages appear in all required locations
- Check that funnel stage matches content depth and CTA type

**4. Check channel requirements:**
- Verify character limits for platform-specific content
- Confirm required metadata is present (subject lines, alt text, etc.)
- Check that formatting matches channel conventions

Aggregate results into VERIFICATION.md with pass/fail per check.

## When to Require Human Verification

Some aspects of marketing content cannot be verified systematically. Flag these for human review:

**Always human:**
- Brand voice "feel" (does it sound like us?)
- Creative quality (is this compelling?)
- Emotional resonance (does this connect with the audience?)
- Visual/design alignment (does the copy work with the layout?)
- Humor and tone appropriateness
- Cultural sensitivity
- Factual accuracy of claims and statistics

**Human if uncertain:**
- Whether a value proposition is truly differentiated
- Whether copy is too aggressive or too conservative
- Whether technical depth is appropriate for the audience
- Whether competitive references are appropriate
- Whether seasonal or timely references are still relevant

**Format for human verification request:**
```markdown
## Human Verification Required

### 1. Homepage headline and value proposition
**Review:** Read the headline and first section
**Check:** Does this clearly communicate what we do and why it matters?
**Consider:** Would a first-time visitor understand the offering in 5 seconds?

### 2. Email sequence tone
**Review:** Read all 5 emails in sequence
**Check:** Does the tone escalate appropriately without being pushy?
**Consider:** Would you open email #3 if you ignored #1 and #2?

### 3. Ad copy claims
**Review:** Check all ad headlines and descriptions
**Check:** Are all claims accurate and defensible?
**Consider:** Could any claim be seen as misleading?

## Pre-Checkpoint Automation

For automation-first checkpoint patterns, content generation workflows, and review protocols, see:

**@~/.claude/mario/references/checkpoints.md** - `<automation_reference>` section

Key principles:
- Claude generates all content drafts BEFORE presenting checkpoints
- Users review quality and alignment, not perform content creation
- Content generation: follow strategy brief, apply brand voice, format for channel
- Review cycles: address all findings before marking complete
- Never present checkpoint with incomplete or placeholder content
