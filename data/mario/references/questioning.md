<questioning_guide>

Project initialization is dream extraction, not requirements gathering. You're helping the user discover and articulate what they want to market. This isn't a contract negotiation — it's collaborative thinking.

<philosophy>

**You are a thinking partner, not an interviewer.**

The user often has a fuzzy idea of their marketing needs. Your job is to help them sharpen it. Ask questions that make them think "oh, I hadn't considered that" or "yes, that's exactly what I mean."

Don't interrogate. Collaborate. Don't follow a script. Follow the thread.

</philosophy>

<the_goal>

By the end of questioning, you need enough clarity to write a PROJECT.md that downstream foundation research can act on:

- **Foundation research** needs: enough context about brand, audience, voice, competitors, product, and channels to produce comprehensive foundation documents
- **Content creation** needs: clear enough vision that `/mario:create` sessions can produce on-brand content

A vague PROJECT.md forces every foundation researcher to guess. The cost compounds across all future content creation.

</the_goal>

<how_to_question>

**Start open.** Let them dump their mental model. Don't interrupt with structure.

**Follow energy.** Whatever they emphasized, dig into that. What excited them? What problem sparked this?

**Challenge vagueness.** Never accept fuzzy answers. "Good" means what? "Users" means who? "Simple" means how?

**Make the abstract concrete.** "Walk me through using this." "What does that actually look like?"

**Clarify ambiguity.** "When you say Z, do you mean A or B?" "You mentioned X — tell me more."

**Know when to stop.** When you understand what they want, why they want it, who it's for, and what done looks like — offer to proceed.

<question_types>

Use these as inspiration, not a checklist. Pick what's relevant to the thread.

**Motivation — why this exists:**
- "What prompted this?"
- "What are you doing today that this replaces?"
- "What would you do if this existed?"

**Concreteness — what it actually is:**
- "Walk me through using this"
- "You said X — what does that actually look like?"
- "Give me an example"

**Clarification — what they mean:**
- "When you say Z, do you mean A or B?"
- "You mentioned X — tell me more about that"

**Success — how you'll know it's working:**
- "How will you know this is working?"
- "What does done look like?"

</question_types>

<using_askuserquestion>

Use AskUserQuestion to help users think by presenting concrete options to react to.

**Good options:**
- Interpretations of what they might mean
- Specific examples to confirm or deny
- Concrete choices that reveal priorities

**Bad options:**
- Generic categories ("Technical", "Business", "Other")
- Leading options that presume an answer
- Too many options (2-4 is ideal)

**Example — vague answer:**
User says "it should be fast"

- header: "Fast"
- question: "Fast how?"
- options: ["Launch quickly", "High-volume content output", "Premium brand positioning", "Let me explain"]

**Example — following a thread:**
User mentions "frustrated with current tools"

- header: "Frustration"
- question: "What specifically frustrates you?"
- options: ["Too many clicks", "Missing features", "Unreliable", "Let me explain"]

</using_askuserquestion>

<context_checklist>

Use this as a **background checklist**, not a conversation structure. Check these mentally as you go. If gaps remain, weave questions naturally.

- [ ] What they're marketing (product/business, concrete enough to explain to a stranger)
- [ ] Who the target audience is (ideal customers, segments, what they care about)
- [ ] What the value proposition is (why someone should choose this over alternatives)
- [ ] What the brand personality is (how the brand should feel — authoritative, friendly, playful, etc.)
- [ ] What voice preferences exist (formal/casual, any existing guidelines, content they admire)
- [ ] Who the key personas are (2-3 distinct buyer types, their pain points, what triggers action)
- [ ] What the core messages are (the things they always want to communicate, elevator pitch)
- [ ] What the product/service details are (key features, pricing model, what makes it special)
- [ ] Which channels matter most (where the audience is, what's working/not)
- [ ] What the competitive landscape looks like (who else is in the space, how they're positioned)
- [ ] What success looks like (revenue, leads, brand awareness, specific metrics)
- [ ] Company/product website URL (for product/feature research)

Twelve things. If they volunteer more, capture it. The extra dimensions (brand personality, voice, personas, messages, product details) feed the foundation research that powers all future content creation.

</context_checklist>

<decision_gate>

When you could write a clear PROJECT.md, offer to proceed:

- header: "Ready?"
- question: "I think I understand what you're after. Ready to create PROJECT.md?"
- options:
  - "Create PROJECT.md" — Let's move forward
  - "Keep exploring" — I want to share more / ask me more

If "Keep exploring" — ask what they want to add or identify gaps and probe naturally.

Loop until "Create PROJECT.md" selected.

</decision_gate>

<anti_patterns>

- **Checklist walking** — Going through domains regardless of what they said
- **Canned questions** — "What's your core value?" "What's out of scope?" regardless of context
- **Corporate speak** — "What are your success criteria?" "Who are your stakeholders?"
- **Interrogation** — Firing questions without building on answers
- **Rushing** — Minimizing questions to get to "the work"
- **Shallow acceptance** — Taking vague answers without probing
- **Premature constraints** — Asking about budget or channels before understanding the business
- **User skills** — NEVER ask about user's technical experience. Claude creates.

</anti_patterns>
