# Part 1: Writing Principles

## 1.1 Clarity Over Cleverness

When forced to choose between a clever turn of phrase and a clear statement, choose clarity. Visitors are scanning, distracted, and skeptical. They will not stop to decode a metaphor.

```
Weak:    "Supercharge your workflow with our paradigm-shifting platform"
Better:  "Ship features in half the time"
```

The test: could someone who knows nothing about your product understand the benefit in 5 seconds? If not, rewrite.

## 1.2 Style Rules

### Sentence Structure

- Average sentence length: 12-18 words
- Mix short sentences (5-8 words) with medium ones (15-20 words)
- Never exceed 30 words in a single sentence on a landing page
- One idea per sentence

### Word Choice

- Prefer one-syllable words when they exist ("use" not "utilize", "help" not "facilitate")
- Use active voice: "We build tools" not "Tools are built by us"
- Be specific: "14-day free trial" not "a generous trial period"
- Use confident language: "This will help you" not "This might help you"

### Formatting for Scanners

- Use subheadings every 2-3 paragraphs
- Bullet points for any list of 3+ items
- Bold the most important phrase in each section
- Keep paragraphs to 2-3 sentences maximum on landing pages
- Use whitespace aggressively

### Show, Don't Tell

```
Telling:  "Our platform is incredibly fast"
Showing:  "Pages load in 47ms. Deploys finish in 90 seconds."

Telling:  "Trusted by leading companies"
Showing:  "Used by 12,000 teams including Stripe, Shopify, and Notion"

Telling:  "Easy to get started"
Showing:  "Set up in 3 steps. No credit card required."
```

## 1.3 The Research Step

Before writing any page, gather:

1. **Page purpose** -- What type of page is this, and what is the single desired visitor action?
2. **Audience** -- Which persona is this page for? What do they already know? What are their objections?
3. **Traffic source** -- Where are visitors coming from? (Search, ads, referral, email) This determines their intent and awareness level.
4. **Product differentiators** -- What is unique about this product? What proof exists?
5. **Competitive context** -- What are the alternatives? How does the prospect evaluate options?

See strategy.md for audience research frameworks and competitive analysis methods.

# Part 2: Page Structure

## 2.1 Universal Page Flow

Most conversion-oriented pages follow this structure:

```
1. Hero Section          -- Headline + subheadline + CTA + visual
2. Social Proof Bar      -- Logos, review scores, user count
3. Problem Section       -- Name the pain
4. Solution Section      -- How the product solves it
5. Features/Benefits     -- What it does and why that matters
6. Social Proof Deep     -- Testimonials, case studies
7. Objection Handling    -- FAQ or addressed concerns
8. Final CTA             -- Repeat the offer with urgency
```

Not every page needs every section. Shorter pages for warm traffic might skip the problem section. Longer pages for cold traffic need all sections and possibly more.

## 2.2 Above-the-Fold Principles

The hero section must accomplish three things before the visitor scrolls:

1. **Communicate the value proposition** -- What is this and why should I care?
2. **Establish relevance** -- Is this for someone like me?
3. **Provide a clear next step** -- What should I do?

### Hero Section Components

```
Headline:       Specific benefit or outcome (5-12 words)
Subheadline:    Expand with how or for whom (1-2 sentences)
Primary CTA:    Single action button with value-driven copy
Visual:         Product screenshot, demo, or relevant image
Social Proof:   Optional -- logo bar or key metric
```

### Above-the-Fold Checklist

```
[ ] Can a visitor understand what this product does in 5 seconds?
[ ] Is the headline benefit-focused (not feature-focused)?
[ ] Is there exactly one primary CTA visible?
[ ] Does the visual support the message (not distract from it)?
[ ] Is the text readable without zooming on mobile?
```

## 2.3 Section Patterns

### Problem Section

Name the pain before presenting the solution. The reader needs to feel understood.

```
Pattern 1: Question Lead
"Tired of spending 3 hours every week on manual deployments?"

Pattern 2: Situation Description
"Your team ships code every day. But every deploy is a gamble --
one bad config and production goes down."

Pattern 3: Cost Quantification
"Manual deployments cost the average team 156 hours per year.
That's nearly a full month of engineering time -- wasted."
```

### Solution Section

Bridge from the problem to your product. Do not jump straight to features.

```
Pattern:
[Product name] [verb] [outcome].
Instead of [old way], you [new way].
[One sentence of how it works at a high level].
```

### Features/Benefits Section

Every feature must be paired with a benefit. The feature is what it does. The benefit is why the reader cares.

```
Format:
[Benefit-oriented subheading]
[1-2 sentences explaining the feature and its outcome]

Example:
"Deploy with confidence"
One-click rollbacks mean you can ship fast without fear.
If anything goes wrong, you are back to the previous version
in under 10 seconds.
```

### Social Proof Section

```
Strong social proof includes:
- Full name and title of the person quoted
- Company name and logo
- Specific result or outcome mentioned
- Photo of the person (increases trust)

Weak social proof:
- Anonymous quotes ("A satisfied customer says...")
- Vague praise ("Great product!")
- Undated testimonials
- Logos without context
```

---

# Part 3: Headline Frameworks

Always write 3-5 headline options. Test the best 2. Headlines are the highest-leverage element on any page -- a strong headline can double conversion rates.

## 3.1 AIDA Headlines

Attention-Interest-Desire-Action compressed into a headline.

```
Template: [Attention-grabbing claim] + [Specific benefit]
Examples:
"12,000 Teams Replaced Their Deploy Scripts with This"
"The Deployment Tool Engineers Actually Want to Use"
```

## 3.2 PAS Headlines

Problem-Agitate-Solve. Name the pain and hint at the solution.

```
Template: [Problem statement]? [Product] [solution].
Examples:
"Still deploying with shell scripts? There's a better way."
"Broken deploys ruining your Friday? Fix them permanently."
```

## 3.3 4U Headlines

Useful, Urgent, Unique, Ultra-specific. Score each headline on all four dimensions.

```
Template: [Specific outcome] + [Timeframe or constraint]
Examples:
"Cut Your Deploy Time to 90 Seconds -- Starting Today"
"Ship 3x More Features This Quarter Without Adding Engineers"
```

Scoring:
```
Useful:         Does it promise a clear benefit?
Urgent:         Is there a reason to act now?
Unique:         Is it different from competitor headlines?
Ultra-specific: Does it use concrete numbers or details?
```

## 3.4 Outcome-Focused Headlines

Lead with the result the customer achieves.

```
Template: [Verb] + [desirable outcome] + [qualifier]
Examples:
"Ship code in minutes, not hours"
"Spend less time deploying and more time building"
"Go from commit to production in 90 seconds"
```

## 3.5 Problem-Focused Headlines

Lead with the pain the customer recognizes.

```
Template: [Pain point] + [implied solution]
Examples:
"Manual deploys are costing you 156 hours per year"
"Your deploy process shouldn't need a runbook"
"Stop choosing between speed and reliability"
```

## 3.6 Social Proof Headlines

Lead with evidence from other customers.

```
Template: [Customer result] + [with/using product]
Examples:
"How Acme Corp cut deploy time by 97%"
"Join 12,000 teams that deploy without fear"
"Rated #1 by engineers on G2 for the third year running"
```

---

# Part 4: CTA Formulas

## 4.1 CTA Anatomy

```
[Action Verb] + [Value/Outcome] + [Qualifier (optional)]
```

The action verb tells them what to do. The value tells them what they get. The qualifier reduces friction.

```
Examples:
"Start Free Trial"              -- action + value
"Get Your Custom Report"        -- action + value
"Start Building -- No Card Required"  -- action + value + qualifier
"See It in Action"              -- action + value
"Deploy Your First App Free"    -- action + value + qualifier
```

## 4.2 Button Copy Patterns

### Primary CTA Buttons

```
Strong:                         Weak:
"Start Free Trial"              "Submit"
"Get Started Free"              "Sign Up"
"See How It Works"              "Learn More"
"Deploy Your First App"         "Click Here"
"Start Building Now"            "Get Started"
"Create Your Account"           "Next"
```

### Secondary CTA Links

```
"See pricing"
"Watch a 2-minute demo"
"Read the case study"
"Talk to sales"
"View documentation"
```

### CTA Microcopy (Below Button)

Reduce friction with a short line beneath the button:

```
"No credit card required"
"Free for teams up to 5"
"Set up in under 2 minutes"
"Cancel anytime"
"14-day free trial, no commitment"
```

## 4.3 CTA Placement Strategy

```
Placement               Purpose
---------               -------
Hero section            Primary conversion point
After benefits section  Capture readers convinced by features
After social proof      Capture readers convinced by evidence
After FAQ               Capture readers whose objections are resolved
Sticky header/footer    Persistent access for ready visitors
```

Rules:
- One primary CTA per page (the same CTA can appear multiple times)
- Secondary CTAs (like "Talk to sales") should be visually subordinate
- Never place two equally prominent CTAs side by side

## 4.4 Urgency and Friction Reduction

### Legitimate Urgency Triggers

```
"Offer ends [specific date]"
"Limited to the first 100 customers"
"Price increases on [date] -- lock in current pricing"
"Cohort starts [date] -- [X] spots remaining"
```

Never fabricate urgency. Fake countdown timers and fake scarcity destroy trust permanently.

### Friction Reduction Techniques

```
Friction Point          Reduction
--------------          ---------
Account creation        "Sign up with Google" / SSO
Credit card required    "No card required for trial"
Long forms              Reduce to email-only for first step
Unclear next steps      "Here's what happens next: ..."
Time commitment         "Takes less than 2 minutes"
Risk                    "30-day money-back guarantee"
```

# Part 5: CRO 7-Dimension Framework

When auditing or optimizing any conversion page, evaluate these seven dimensions in order of impact.

## 5.1 Value Proposition Clarity

The most common conversion killer is an unclear value proposition.

### Assessment Questions

```
- Can a new visitor explain what this product does in one sentence?
- Is the headline about the customer's outcome (not the product's features)?
- Does the subheadline expand with specifics (who, how, or proof)?
- Is the value proposition differentiated from competitors?
```

### Common Problems

```
Problem:     Feature-heavy messaging ("AI-powered real-time analytics engine")
Fix:         Benefit-led messaging ("See what's working in your campaigns -- live")

Problem:     Jargon and buzzwords ("Synergize your cross-functional workflows")
Fix:         Plain language ("Help your team work together without meetings")

Problem:     Vague claims ("The best solution for modern teams")
Fix:         Specific claims ("Used by 12,000 teams to ship 3x faster")
```

## 5.2 Headline Effectiveness

### Headline Audit Checklist

```
[ ] Communicates a specific benefit (not just a feature)
[ ] Uses language the target audience actually uses
[ ] Can be understood in under 5 seconds
[ ] Is different from the top 3 competitors' headlines
[ ] Includes specific numbers, timeframes, or outcomes where possible
[ ] Works on mobile (short enough to display in 2 lines or fewer)
```

## 5.3 CTA Quality

### CTA Audit Checklist

```
[ ] Primary CTA is visible above the fold
[ ] Button copy uses action verb + value (not "Submit" or "Click Here")
[ ] Only one primary CTA type per page (may appear in multiple locations)
[ ] Secondary CTAs are visually subordinate
[ ] Friction-reducing microcopy appears near the CTA
[ ] CTA contrasts with the page background (visually prominent)
```

## 5.4 Visual Hierarchy and Scannability

### Assessment

```
[ ] Headline is the largest, most prominent text on the page
[ ] Key benefits can be understood by scanning headings only
[ ] Body text uses short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
[ ] Bullet points are used for lists of 3+ items
[ ] Whitespace separates sections clearly
[ ] Important elements are not buried below long text blocks
[ ] Page works on mobile without horizontal scrolling
```

### The Squint Test

Squint at the page until the text blurs. You should still be able to identify:
- Where the headline is
- Where the CTA is
- The major section breaks

If you cannot, the visual hierarchy needs work.

## 5.5 Trust Signals and Social Proof

### Placement Strategy

```
Element                 Best Placement
-------                 --------------
Logo bar                Below the hero section
Star ratings            Near the headline or CTA
Testimonials            After features/benefits section
Case study links        After testimonials
Security badges         Near forms and payment sections
Media mentions          Footer or dedicated section
```

### Trust Signal Audit

```
[ ] At least one form of social proof is visible above the fold
[ ] Testimonials include real names, titles, and companies
[ ] Customer logos are recognizable to the target audience
[ ] Numbers are specific ("12,347 teams" not "thousands of teams")
[ ] Trust signals are placed near decision points (CTAs, forms, pricing)
```

## 5.6 Objection Handling

### Identifying Objections

Source objections from:
- Sales team (most common reasons deals stall)
- Support team (most common pre-purchase questions)
- Customer interviews (what almost stopped them from buying)
- Competitor reviews (complaints about the category)

See strategy.md for the full objection mapping framework.

### Addressing Objections in Copy

```
Technique             Example
---------             -------
FAQ section           "Is my data secure? Yes. We are SOC 2 certified..."
Inline callout        "No credit card required. Cancel anytime."
Guarantee badge       "30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked"
Comparison table      "See how we compare to [competitor]"
Case study            "How [similar company] solved this exact problem"
```

## 5.7 Friction Points

### Common Friction Points

```
Friction                    Impact      Fix
--------                    ------      ---
Long sign-up forms          High        Reduce to email only; collect more later
Unclear pricing             High        Show pricing or "starting at" on the page
No free option              Medium      Add a free trial or freemium tier
Slow page load              High        Optimize images, reduce scripts, use CDN
Confusing navigation        Medium      Simplify nav; remove distractions on landing pages
No mobile optimization      High        Mobile-first design; test on real devices
Unclear next steps          Medium      Describe what happens after they click
Required phone number       Medium      Remove unless absolutely necessary
```

4. Feature comparison table: What is included in each tier
5. FAQ: Address pricing-specific questions
6. Social proof: Customer logos or "Join X teams" count
7. CTA per plan: "Start Free" / "Start Trial" / "Contact Sales"

Key principles:
- Anchor with the highest plan first (left to right)

6. Social proof: Testimonial specific to this feature
7. CTA: Start trial or explore related features

Key principle: Each feature page should answer
"What problem does this solve?" not just "What does this do?"
```

---

# Part 7: Microcopy

Small-text copy has outsized impact on user experience and conversion. Treat microcopy with the same care as headlines.

## 7.1 Form Labels and Helpers

```
Instead of:     Use:
"Name"          "Full name" (removes ambiguity)
"Email"         "Work email" (signals B2B context if applicable)
"Phone"         "Phone (optional)" (reduces abandonment)
"Company"       "Company name"
"Message"       "How can we help?"
```

Helper text beneath fields:

```
"We'll send your report here"          (under email field)
"Used to personalize your experience"  (under name field)
"We'll never share this"               (under phone field)
```

## 7.2 Error Messages

Error messages must tell the user what went wrong and how to fix it.

```
Bad:    "Invalid input"
Good:   "Please enter a valid email address (e.g., name@company.com)"

Bad:    "Error 422"
Good:   "That email is already registered. Try signing in instead."

Bad:    "Required field"
Good:   "Please enter your company name to continue"
```

### Error Message Formula

```
[What happened] + [How to fix it]
```

## 7.3 Empty States

When a section or page has no content yet, use the empty state to guide the user.

```
Bad:    "No results found"
Good:   "No campaigns yet. Create your first campaign to start tracking results."

Bad:    "Nothing here"
Good:   "Your inbox is empty. New messages will appear here."
```

### Empty State Formula

```
[Acknowledgment of emptiness] + [What to do next] + [Optional CTA button]
```

## 7.4 Confirmation and Success Messages

```
Bad:    "Success"
Good:   "Your account has been created. Check your email for next steps."

Bad:    "Done"
Good:   "Campaign published. It will start running within 15 minutes."
```

### Confirmation Formula

```
[What happened] + [What happens next]
```

## 7.5 Tooltips and Contextual Help

Keep tooltips under 20 words. They should clarify, not teach.

```
Good:   "This is the name your team members will see"
Good:   "Changing this will update all future invoices"
Bad:    "The display name field allows you to configure the name that will
         be shown to other users of the platform when they view..." (too long)
```
