# Part 1: Audience Definition

Before writing any marketing copy, you must understand who you are writing for. Audience definition is the foundation that every other marketing decision rests on.

## 1.1 Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs)

An ICP describes the type of company or individual most likely to get value from the product. It is not a persona (that comes later). It is a set of firmographic and behavioral characteristics.

### B2B ICP Template

```
Company Size:       [employee count range]
Annual Revenue:     [revenue range]
Industry:           [specific verticals]
Geography:          [regions/markets]
Tech Stack:         [relevant tools they already use]
Buying Process:     [who initiates, who approves, cycle length]
Current Solution:   [what they use today]
Trigger Events:     [what makes them start looking]
Disqualifiers:      [characteristics that make them a bad fit]
```

### B2C ICP Template

```
Demographics:       [age, income, education, location]
Psychographics:     [values, interests, lifestyle]
Behavior:           [buying habits, media consumption, brand affinities]
Current Solution:   [what they use or do today]
Trigger Events:     [life events or moments that create need]
Disqualifiers:      [who is not a good fit despite surface match]
```

### ICP Prioritization

When multiple ICPs exist, rank them:

1. **Primary ICP** -- Highest lifetime value, shortest sales cycle, strongest product-market fit
2. **Secondary ICP** -- Good fit but longer cycle or lower value
3. **Aspirational ICP** -- Future target that requires product or market development

All marketing defaults to the Primary ICP unless explicitly targeting another segment.

## 1.2 Jobs-to-Be-Done Framework

JTBD reframes the audience around what they are trying to accomplish rather than who they are. Customers do not buy products. They hire products to do a job.

### Job Statement Formula

```
When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome].
```

Examples:

```
When I am scaling my team from 5 to 20 engineers, I want to standardize
our deployment process, so I can ship features without worrying about
breaking production.

When I am preparing a quarterly board presentation, I want to pull
accurate metrics from multiple sources, so I can tell a coherent
growth story in under an hour.
```

### Job Map (8 Steps)

Every job follows a universal process. Map content and messaging to each step:

1. **Define** -- What does the customer need to accomplish?
2. **Locate** -- What inputs, information, or resources do they need?
3. **Prepare** -- How do they set up to do the job?
4. **Confirm** -- How do they verify they are ready?
5. **Execute** -- How do they perform the core task?
6. **Monitor** -- How do they track progress during execution?
7. **Modify** -- How do they adjust when things change?
8. **Conclude** -- How do they finish and evaluate success?

### Outcome Statements

Outcomes are measurable criteria customers use to evaluate whether a product does the job well. Format:

```
[Direction] + [metric] + [object of control] + [context]
```

Examples:

```
Minimize the time it takes to deploy a code change to production.
Minimize the likelihood of introducing a regression during deployment.
Increase the visibility of deployment status across the team.
```

Use outcome statements as the basis for benefit-driven copy. Each outcome maps directly to a headline or bullet point.

## 1.3 Buyer Persona Templates

Personas add human detail to ICPs. They represent individuals within the ICP who participate in the buying decision.

### Persona Template

```
Name:               [fictional but realistic]
Title/Role:         [specific job title]
Reports To:         [who they answer to]
Day-to-Day:         [3-5 daily responsibilities]
Goals:              [what success looks like in their role]
Frustrations:       [recurring pain points]
Information Sources: [where they learn, who they trust]
Objections:         [why they would hesitate to buy]
Decision Role:      [initiator / influencer / decision-maker / buyer / user]
Preferred Channels: [email, LinkedIn, Twitter, Slack communities, etc.]
Quote:              [a sentence that captures their mindset]
```

### Decision Roles

In B2B purchases, multiple personas participate:

- **Initiator** -- Identifies the problem and starts the search
- **Influencer** -- Provides input and evaluation criteria
- **Decision-Maker** -- Has final authority to approve
- **Buyer** -- Handles procurement and negotiation
- **User** -- Will use the product day-to-day

Map content types to each role:

| Role | Content Type |
|------|-------------|
| Initiator | Blog posts, social content, problem-focused pages |
| Influencer | Comparison pages, technical docs, case studies |
| Decision-Maker | ROI calculators, executive summaries, testimonials |
| Buyer | Pricing pages, contract terms, security documentation |
| User | Product demos, tutorials, onboarding guides |

## 1.4 Audience Research Methods

### Primary Research

- **Customer interviews** -- 15-20 minute calls with 8-12 customers. Ask about the situation before purchase, what triggered the search, what alternatives they considered, and what almost stopped them.
- **Win/loss analysis** -- Interview recent wins and losses to identify patterns in decision factors.
- **Support ticket analysis** -- Categorize recurring themes in support requests to identify unmet needs and language patterns.
- **Sales call recordings** -- Extract the exact phrases prospects use to describe their problems.

### Secondary Research

- **Review mining** -- Read competitor reviews on G2, Capterra, TrustRadius, or the App Store. Extract pain points, praise language, and feature requests.
- **Community monitoring** -- Track relevant subreddits, Hacker News threads, Stack Overflow questions, and industry Slack groups.
- **Search query analysis** -- Use keyword tools to find how prospects describe their problems in search terms.
- **Social listening** -- Monitor mentions of competitors and category terms on social platforms.

### Language Extraction

The single most valuable research output is a vocabulary list of exact phrases customers use. Capture:

- How they describe their problem (not how you describe it)
- How they describe the desired outcome
- How they compare alternatives
- Words they use repeatedly

Mirror this language in all copy. Customers should feel like the marketing was written by someone who understands their situation because it literally uses their words.

# Part 2: Brand Voice

Brand voice is the consistent personality expressed through all written communication. It remains stable. Tone varies by context.

## 2.1 Voice Attributes Matrix

Define 4-6 attributes on a spectrum. Each attribute has a "we are" side and a "we are not" side.

### Example Matrix

```
Attribute       We Are              We Are Not
-----------     --------            ----------
Confidence      Direct, assured     Arrogant, dismissive
Clarity         Plain-spoken        Jargon-heavy, academic
Warmth          Friendly, human     Stiff, corporate
Expertise       Knowledgeable       Condescending, pedantic
Ambition        Forward-looking     Unrealistic, hype-driven
Humor           Dry, occasional     Sarcastic, forced
```

### Using the Matrix

When reviewing copy, check each sentence against the matrix:

1. Does this sound like our "We Are" column?
2. Does it accidentally drift toward "We Are Not"?
3. If an attribute is missing from a piece, is that intentional?

## 2.2 Tone Variation by Context

Voice stays constant. Tone shifts based on audience and situation.

### Tone Spectrum

```
Context                 Tone Shift
-------                 ----------
Error messages          More empathetic, less casual
Sales pages             More confident, more direct
Technical docs          More precise, less warm
Social media            More casual, more humor
Customer success        More warm, more supportive
Crisis comms            More serious, more transparent
Onboarding emails       More encouraging, more patient
Executive content       More formal, more data-driven
```

### Tone Calibration Questions

Before writing, answer:

1. What is the reader's emotional state right now?
2. What do we want them to feel after reading?
3. How high are the stakes for them?
4. Is this a first impression or an ongoing relationship?

## 2.3 Voice Documentation

### Voice Quick Reference Card

Create a one-page reference that any writer can use:

```
VOICE SUMMARY
We sound like: [a knowledgeable colleague who respects your time]
We never sound like: [a used car salesman / a textbook / a chatbot]

DO:
- Use "you" and "your" (second person)
- Write short sentences (under 20 words average)
- Lead with the benefit, follow with the feature
- Use specific numbers over vague claims

DON'T:
- Use buzzwords (synergy, leverage, holistic, cutting-edge)
- Write in passive voice unless emphasis requires it
- Use exclamation points in body copy
- Make claims you cannot prove with data or evidence
```

### Word Lists

**Preferred vocabulary:**

```
Instead of...          Use...
--------------         ------
utilize                use
leverage               use, build on
facilitate             help, enable
robust                 strong, reliable
seamless               smooth, easy
cutting-edge           modern, latest
end-to-end             complete, full
best-in-class          leading, top
```

**Power words for marketing copy:**

```
Action:     launch, build, create, ship, grow, unlock, discover
Outcome:    faster, simpler, clearer, reliable, accurate, proven
Urgency:    now, today, limited, before, while, deadline
Trust:      guaranteed, proven, verified, backed, certified
```

# Part 3: Positioning

Positioning defines how your product occupies a distinct place in the prospect's mind relative to alternatives.

## 3.1 Category Definition

Before positioning within a category, decide what category you compete in. This is the single most important positioning decision.

### Category Options

1. **Existing category** -- Compete in an established market. Requires differentiation.
2. **Subcategory** -- Narrow an existing category. Position as the specialist.
3. **New category** -- Create a category that did not exist. Requires educating the market.

### Category Selection Criteria

```
Choose existing category when:
- Buyers already search for this category
- You can clearly differentiate on 1-2 dimensions
- The market is large enough to support multiple players

Choose subcategory when:
- The main category is crowded
- You serve a specific segment better than generalists
- Your differentiator aligns with a definable group

Choose new category when:
- No existing category describes what you do
- You can define the criteria for evaluation
- You have resources to educate the market (6-18 months)
```

## 3.2 Competitive Framing

Every position is relative. Define yours in relation to alternatives.

### Frame Types

1. **Head-to-head** -- "We do what they do, but better at X"
2. **Flanking** -- "We serve a segment they ignore"
3. **Reframing** -- "The way you have been solving this is wrong. Here is why."
4. **Uncontested** -- "No one else does this specific thing"

### The "Compared to What?" Test

Every claim needs an implicit or explicit comparison:

```
Weak:   "Fast deployment"
Better: "Deploy in 2 minutes instead of 2 hours"
Best:   "Deploy in 2 minutes -- 60x faster than manual configuration"
```

## 3.3 Differentiation Strategy

Differentiation must be meaningful (matters to buyers), provable (can demonstrate), and sustainable (hard for competitors to copy).

### Differentiation Dimensions

```
Dimension          Example
---------          -------
Feature            "The only tool with built-in X"
Workflow           "Designed around how designers actually work"
Audience           "Built specifically for teams under 50"
Philosophy         "We believe complexity kills productivity"
Integration        "Native integration with your existing stack"
Outcome            "Average customer sees results in 14 days"
Experience         "No learning curve -- works like the tools you know"
Price/Value        "Enterprise features at startup prices"
```

### Differentiation Validation

For each claimed differentiator, verify:

1. Do customers actually care about this? (Check interview data)
2. Can we prove it with evidence? (Data, demos, testimonials)
3. Is it hard for competitors to replicate? (Moat assessment)
4. Does it hold up under scrutiny? (Competitor comparison)

## 3.4 Positioning Statement Template

### Internal Positioning Statement

Not for external use. Aligns the team.

```
For [target customer]
who [statement of need or opportunity],
[product name] is a [product category]
that [key benefit or promise].
Unlike [primary competitive alternative],
our product [primary differentiation].
```

Example:

```
For mid-market engineering teams
who struggle with inconsistent deployment processes,
ShipFast is a deployment automation platform
that reduces release time from hours to minutes.
Unlike Jenkins or manual scripts,
ShipFast requires zero configuration and works
with any CI/CD pipeline out of the box.
```

### External Positioning (Elevator Pitch)

A customer-facing version. 2-3 sentences maximum.

```
[Product] helps [audience] [achieve outcome] by [mechanism].
Instead of [old way], you [new way], so you can [benefit].
```

---

# Part 4: Competitive Analysis

## 4.1 The Four Forces of Switching

Understanding why customers switch (or do not) requires analyzing four competing forces:

```
FORCES PUSHING TOWARD CHANGE:
  1. Push of Current Solution -- Frustrations with what they use now
  2. Pull of New Solution -- Attraction of the new product's benefits

FORCES RESISTING CHANGE:
  3. Habit of Current Solution -- Comfort, familiarity, sunk costs
  4. Anxiety of New Solution -- Fear of learning curve, migration risk, unknown
```

### Application to Marketing

```
Force                Marketing Response
-----                ------------------
Push (current pain)  Problem-agitate copy, "sound familiar?" content
Pull (new benefit)   Benefit-driven headlines, demo/trial offers
Habit (resistance)   Migration guides, "works with your existing tools"
Anxiety (fear)       Guarantees, free trials, case studies, support promises
```

### Interview Questions by Force

```
Push:    "What made you start looking for something new?"
Pull:    "What caught your attention about our product?"
Habit:   "What would you miss about your current tool?"
Anxiety: "What concerns did you have before signing up?"
```

## 4.2 Competitor Matrix

### Feature Comparison Matrix

```
Feature              Us    Competitor A    Competitor B    Competitor C
-------              --    ------------    ------------    ------------
[Feature 1]          Y     Y               N               Y
[Feature 2]          Y     N               Y               N
[Feature 3]          Y     Y               Y               N
Pricing              $$    $$$             $               $$
Target Audience      X     X+Y             Y               X
Deployment Model     SaaS  On-prem         SaaS            Both
```

### Positioning Perceptual Map

Place competitors on two axes that matter to buyers:

```
                    High Ease of Use
                         |
                         |
    Budget -----+--------+--------+----- Enterprise
                         |
                         |
                    High Complexity
```

Choose axes where you occupy a favorable and differentiated position.

## 4.3 Competitive Intelligence Gathering

### Sources

- **Public**: Pricing pages, feature pages, changelogs, blog posts, job postings
- **Reviews**: G2, Capterra, TrustRadius -- read 1-star and 5-star reviews
- **Social**: Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Reddit threads mentioning competitors
- **Community**: Competitor community forums, Discord servers, support docs
- **Sales**: Win/loss interviews that mention specific competitors

### What to Track

- Pricing changes (set up alerts on pricing page URLs)
- New feature launches (monitor changelog or blog)
- Messaging changes (screenshot and compare quarterly)
- Customer complaints (review sites and social)
- Hiring patterns (job postings indicate strategic direction)

# Part 5: Messaging Hierarchy

The messaging hierarchy creates consistency across all channels by establishing a layered system from shortest to longest expression of value.

## 5.1 Messaging Levels

### Level 1: One-Liner (under 10 words)

Used in: navigation, app store listing, social bios, referral descriptions

```
Template: [Verb] + [object] + [qualifier]
Example:  "Ship code faster without breaking things"
Example:  "Turn customer calls into product insights"
```

### Level 2: Elevator Pitch (2-3 sentences)

Used in: homepage hero, about page intro, email signatures, pitch decks

```
Template: [Product] helps [audience] [outcome]. Instead of [old way],
          you [new way]. [Proof point or differentiator].
```

### Level 3: Full Narrative (1-2 paragraphs)

Used in: about page, investor materials, press kit, detailed product pages

Includes:
- The problem and why it matters
- The approach and why it is different
- Evidence of results
- Vision for the future

### Level 4: Proof Points

Supporting evidence organized by claim:

```
Claim: "Reduces deployment time by 60x"
Proof:
  - Customer case study: Acme Corp went from 2 hours to 2 minutes
  - Aggregate data: Average across 500 customers
  - Third-party validation: Featured in [publication]
```

## 5.2 Proof Points

### Types of Proof

Ranked by persuasive strength:

1. **Customer results with specific numbers** -- "Increased conversion by 34%"
2. **Named customer testimonials** -- Real names, real companies, real results
3. **Aggregate data** -- "Used by 10,000+ teams"
4. **Expert endorsements** -- Industry analysts, respected practitioners
5. **Awards and recognition** -- G2 Leader, Product Hunt #1
6. **Media mentions** -- Coverage in trusted publications
7. **Certifications** -- SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR compliance

### Proof Point Collection

For each key claim in the messaging hierarchy:

```
Claim:              [the thing you assert]
Evidence Type:      [data / testimonial / case study / certification]
Source:             [where the evidence comes from]
Specificity:        [exact numbers if available]
Recency:            [when the evidence was generated]
Permission:         [can you use this publicly?]
```

## 5.3 Objection Map

List every reason a prospect might not buy. Map each to a response and a content asset.

### Common Objection Categories

```
Category        Example Objection              Response Strategy
--------        -----------------              -----------------
Price           "It's too expensive"           ROI calculator, cost comparison
Trust           "I've never heard of you"      Case studies, reviews, logos
Timing          "Not the right time"           Quick-start guide, trial offer
Complexity      "Looks hard to set up"         Demo, onboarding walkthrough
Risk            "What if it doesn't work?"     Guarantee, trial, pilot program
Switching       "Migration seems painful"      Migration guide, support offer
Authority       "I can't approve this alone"   Executive summary, ROI deck
Fit             "Not sure it's right for us"   Use case pages, persona content
```

### Objection Handling in Copy

Every landing page should address the top 3 objections for its target persona. Common placement:

- FAQ section at bottom of page
- Inline callouts near the CTA
- Trust badges and guarantees near pricing
- Testimonials that specifically address the objection

# Part 6: Psychological Models for Persuasion

These models describe how humans actually make decisions. Apply them ethically -- to help customers make good decisions faster, not to manipulate.

## 6.1 Core Principles

### Reciprocity

Give something valuable before asking for anything. Free tools, educational content, and helpful advice create a sense of obligation.

Application: Lead magnets, free tiers, valuable blog content, free templates.

### Social Proof

People look to others when uncertain. The more similar the proof source is to the prospect, the more persuasive it is.

Application: Testimonials from similar companies, user counts, logo bars, case studies, review scores.

### Authority

People defer to credible experts. Demonstrated expertise reduces evaluation effort.

Application: Expert bylines, certifications, media mentions, data-driven content, thought leadership.

### Scarcity

Limited availability increases perceived value. Only use when the scarcity is genuine.

Application: Limited-time pricing, cohort-based programs, waitlists, exclusive access.

### Commitment and Consistency

Once someone takes a small step, they are more likely to take the next step to remain consistent with their self-image.

Application: Free trials, micro-commitments (save a bookmark, create a free account), progressive profiling.

### Loss Aversion

Losses feel roughly twice as painful as equivalent gains feel good. Frame messages around what the prospect stands to lose by not acting.

Application: "Don't miss out" framing, cost-of-inaction calculators, "what you're losing" messaging.

## 6.2 Decision-Making Biases

### Anchoring

The first number encountered heavily influences subsequent judgments. Present the highest-value plan first. Show the "before" cost before the "after" savings.

### Framing Effect

The same information presented differently produces different decisions. "95% uptime" feels different from "down 18 days per year" even though they are equivalent.

### Default Effect

People tend to accept pre-selected options. Design defaults that serve the customer well -- choose the most popular plan as the default, pre-check beneficial settings.

### Paradox of Choice

Too many options cause decision paralysis. Limit pricing tiers to 3. Limit CTAs per page to 1-2. Reduce form fields to the minimum.

### Peak-End Rule

People judge experiences by the peak moment and the ending. Design memorable positive peaks (first success, key insight) and strong endings (confirmation pages, follow-up emails).

## 6.3 Behavioral Frameworks

### BJ Fogg Behavior Model

```
Behavior = Motivation x Ability x Prompt

All three must be present simultaneously.
```

If conversion is low:
- Is motivation insufficient? (Improve value proposition)
- Is ability too low? (Reduce friction, simplify)
- Is the prompt missing or poorly timed? (Add or reposition CTA)

### AIDA Model

```
Attention  -- Stop the scroll, interrupt the pattern
Interest   -- Connect to their situation
Desire     -- Show the outcome they want
Action     -- Tell them exactly what to do next
```

### PAS Framework

```
Problem   -- Name the pain they are experiencing
Agitate   -- Make the consequences vivid
Solve     -- Present your product as the resolution
```

## 6.4 Ethical Application Guidelines

1. **Never fabricate scarcity.** If there is no limit, do not imply one.
2. **Never invent social proof.** All testimonials, logos, and numbers must be real.
3. **Never exploit fear.** Acknowledge real consequences without exaggerating.
4. **Always deliver on promises.** Every claim in marketing must be backed by the product experience.
5. **Serve the customer's interests.** Apply psychology to help them make the right decision faster, not to pressure them into the wrong one.

# Part 7: Content Quality -- E-E-A-T Framework

E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) is Google's quality framework. Apply it to all marketing content regardless of whether SEO is a goal.

## 7.1 Experience

Demonstrate first-hand experience with the subject matter.

- Include real examples from actual usage
- Reference specific situations, not hypothetical ones
- Use screenshots, data, and artifacts from real work
- Write from a practitioner perspective, not a summary perspective

## 7.2 Expertise

Show deep knowledge of the topic.

- Go beyond surface-level advice
- Address edge cases and nuances
- Cite specific frameworks, methods, and data
- Provide actionable detail, not just concepts

## 7.3 Authoritativeness

Establish the author and brand as recognized sources.

- Include author bios with relevant credentials
- Link to original research, data, or tools you created
- Reference contributions to the broader community
- Show depth of coverage across related topics

## 7.4 Trustworthiness

Build and maintain trust through transparency.

- Disclose limitations and trade-offs
- Cite sources for claims and statistics
- Keep content accurate and up-to-date
- Be transparent about commercial relationships
