# Part 1: Core Principles

## 1.1 One Email, One Job

Every email has exactly one purpose and one primary call-to-action. When an email tries to do two things, it does neither well.

```
Bad:  "Check out our new feature, read our latest blog post,
       and don't forget to invite your team!"

Good: "See how the new reporting dashboard works" + one CTA button
```

Before writing any email, answer: "What is the one thing the reader should do after reading this?" If the answer is two things, write two emails.

## 1.2 Value Before Ask

The ratio of value-giving emails to ask-emails should be at least 3:1 in any sequence. Value means content that helps the reader independent of whether they buy.

```
Sequence position:     Email type:
1                      Value (deliver what they signed up for)
2                      Value (teach something useful)
3                      Value (share a relevant story or insight)
4                      Ask  (present the offer or conversion step)
5                      Value (address a common challenge)
6                      Value (social proof / case study)
7                      Ask  (repeat the offer with urgency)
```

## 1.3 Writing for the Inbox

### Tone

Write as if you are emailing one person. Use "you" and "I" (or "we" for company emails). Keep it conversational. Read it aloud -- if it sounds like marketing copy, rewrite it.

```
Bad:  "We are excited to announce the launch of our new platform
       that will revolutionize how your organization manages..."

Good: "I wanted to show you something we just shipped.
       It solves the exact problem you mentioned when you signed up."
```

### Length

```
Email Type         Target Length
----------         -------------
Transactional      50-125 words
Welcome            100-200 words
Educational        150-300 words
Story-driven       300-500 words
Promotional        100-200 words
Re-engagement      50-150 words
```

### Formatting

- Short paragraphs: 1-3 sentences
- Generous whitespace between paragraphs
- Bullet points for lists (but not every email needs bullets)
- One link or button as the primary CTA
- Mobile-first: assume 60%+ of opens are on mobile

---

# Part 2: Sequence Types

## 2.1 Welcome Sequence

**Purpose**: Introduce the brand, deliver promised value, build trust, and move toward first conversion.

**Trigger**: New subscriber or lead magnet download.

**Length**: 5-7 emails over 12-14 days.

### Sequence Map

```

                    showcase
7       Day 12-14   Conversion push:        Start trial / buy / book a call
                    direct ask
```

### Email 1: Welcome Email (Template)

```
Subject: [Promised resource] is ready for you
Preview: Plus one thing most people miss about [topic]

Body:
- Thank them for signing up
- Deliver the promised resource (link/attachment)
- Set expectations for what emails are coming
- One quick tip they can use right now
- CTA: Access the resource

Length: 100-150 words
```

### Email 4: Social Proof (Template)

```
Subject: How [Customer Name] [achieved specific result]
Preview: [Specific metric or outcome]

Body:
- Brief setup: who the customer is and what they needed
- What they did (1-2 sentences)
- The result (specific numbers)
- Connection to the reader ("You can do the same")
- CTA: View the full case study

Length: 150-200 words
```

## 2.2 Lead Nurture Sequence

**Purpose**: Educate leads, build trust, and move them from awareness to consideration to decision.

**Trigger**: Downloaded a resource, attended a webinar, or entered a campaign.

**Length**: 7-10 emails over 2-4 weeks.

### Sequence Map

```
Email   Timing      Purpose                 CTA
-----   ------      -------                 ---
1       Immediate   Deliver resource +      Access the resource
                    introduce
2       Day 2-3     Expand on the topic     Read related content
3       Day 4-5     Problem deep-dive       Self-assess (quiz/checklist)
4       Day 6-8     Solution framework      View how-to guide

                    this approach works
7       Day 15-18   Objection handling      Reply or book a call
8       Day 19-21   Direct offer            Start trial / demo / purchase
```

### Key Principle

Each email builds on the previous one. The reader should feel like they are progressing through a curriculum, not receiving random marketing messages.

## 2.3 Onboarding Sequence

**Purpose**: Help new users reach their first success as quickly as possible.

**Trigger**: Account creation or first login.

**Length**: 5-7 emails over 14 days, coordinated with in-app guidance.

### Sequence Map

```
Email   Timing      Purpose                 CTA
-----   ------      -------                 ---
1       Immediate   Welcome + getting       Complete setup step 1
                    started
2       Day 1       Quick win: simplest     Complete one key action
                    valuable action
3       Day 3       Feature highlight:      Try the highlighted feature
                    most-loved feature
4       Day 5       Success story from      View the case study
                    similar user
5       Day 7       Engagement check:       Reply or visit help docs
                    "How's it going?"
6       Day 10      Advanced tip            Try an advanced feature
7       Day 14      Upgrade / retain        Upgrade or continue with feedback
```

### Behavioral Branching

Onboarding sequences should branch based on user behavior:

```
User completed setup?
|
+-- YES --> Skip setup reminder, send feature discovery email
+-- NO  --> Send setup reminder with help resources
```

```
User active in last 3 days?
|
+-- YES --> Send advanced tips
+-- NO  --> Send re-engagement / "need help?" email
```

## 2.4 Re-Engagement Sequence

**Purpose**: Win back subscribers or users who have gone inactive.

**Trigger**: No open or click in 30-60 days (subscribers) or no login in 14-30 days (users).

**Length**: 3-5 emails over 10-14 days.

### Sequence Map

```
Email   Timing      Purpose                 CTA
-----   ------      -------                 ---
1       Day 0       Genuine check-in:       Reply or visit
                    "Still interested?"
2       Day 3-4     Value reminder: what    Re-engage with one feature
                    they are missing
3       Day 7-8     Incentive (optional):   Use the incentive
                    special offer
4       Day 10-14   Final: "Stay or go?"    Update preferences or unsubscribe
```

### Email 1: Check-In (Template)

```
Subject: Are we still a good fit?
Preview: No pressure -- just checking in

Body:
- Acknowledge it's been a while
- Remind them of the core value (1 sentence)
- Ask if there's something you can help with
- CTA: Reply, visit the product, or update preferences

Length: 50-100 words
Tone: Human, no pressure, respectful of their time
```

### Email 4: Final Email (Template)

```
Subject: Should I stop emailing you?
Preview: Totally fine either way

Body:
- Direct: "I haven't heard from you in a while"
- Two clear options: stay subscribed or unsubscribe
- No guilt. No pressure.
- CTA: "Keep me subscribed" button + "Unsubscribe" link

Length: 50-75 words
```

If no engagement after the final email, move to a suppressed segment. Do not keep emailing inactive contacts.

## 2.5 Promotional Sequence

**Purpose**: Drive a specific conversion for a time-limited offer.

**Length**: 3-5 emails over the promotion period.

### Sequence Map

```
Email   Timing         Purpose                 CTA
-----   ------         -------                 ---
1       Launch day     Announce the offer       Take the offer
2       Mid-campaign   Social proof + reminder  Take the offer
3       Final day      Last chance / urgency    Take the offer (final)
```

Only run promotional sequences when the offer is genuine. Do not manufacture urgency.

## 2.6 Transactional Emails

**Purpose**: Confirm an action the user took. These are not marketing emails but they are brand touchpoints.

### Types

```
- Account confirmation
- Password reset
- Purchase receipt
- Shipping notification
- Invoice / billing
- Plan change confirmation
```

### Writing Principles for Transactional Emails

1. Lead with the information they need ("Your order is confirmed")
2. Include all relevant details (order number, amount, date)
3. Set expectations ("You'll receive tracking in 24 hours")
4. Provide a help path ("Questions? Reply to this email")
5. Keep marketing to a minimum (a small relevant CTA at the bottom is acceptable)

# Part 3: Subject Lines

## 3.1 Subject Line Frameworks

### Curiosity Gap

Create an information gap the reader wants to close.

```
"The one thing most teams get wrong about [topic]"
"I was wrong about [common belief]"
"This changed how I think about [topic]"
```

### Benefit-Driven

Lead with what the reader gets.

```
"Cut your [task] time in half"
"3 ways to [achieve desirable outcome] this week"
"Your guide to [outcome] is ready"
```

### Urgency

Create time pressure (only when genuine).

```
"Last day: [Offer] ends tonight"
"[X] spots left for [event/cohort]"
"Price goes up Friday -- lock in your rate"
```

### Personalization

Use the reader's context or data.

```
"[Name], your [thing] is ready"
"Your [metric] went up [X]% this week"
"Based on your [action], you might like..."
```

### Question-Based

Ask a question the reader wants answered.

```
"Are you making this [topic] mistake?"
"What would you do with 10 extra hours per week?"
"Ready to [achieve outcome]?"
```

## 3.2 Preview Text Strategy

Preview text appears after the subject line in the inbox. It is a second headline.

### Rules

- Never let it default to "View this email in your browser"
- It should complement the subject line, not repeat it
- 40-90 characters is the visible range on most clients
- Use it to add context the subject line could not fit

```
Subject:  "Your weekly report is ready"
Preview:  "Traffic is up 23% -- here's what's driving it"

Subject:  "3 ways to ship faster"
Preview:  "Tip #2 saved one team 6 hours per week"
```

## 3.3 Subject Line Testing

### A/B Testing Rules

- Test one variable at a time (subject line OR preview text, not both)
- Minimum sample: 1,000 recipients per variant
- Wait for statistical significance before declaring a winner
- Run the test on 20% of the list, send the winner to the remaining 80%

### What to Test

```
Variable           Example A                  Example B
--------           ---------                  ---------
Length             Short (3-5 words)          Long (8-12 words)
Format            Statement                  Question
Specificity       Vague ("Tips for you")     Specific ("3 tips for Q2")
Personalization   With name                  Without name
Emoji             With emoji                 Without emoji
Tone              Formal                     Casual
```

---

# Part 4: Email Structure

## 4.1 Opening Hooks

The first 1-2 sentences determine whether the reader continues. Never open with company news or product announcements. Open with something relevant to the reader.

### Hook Types

```
Story hook:     "Last week, one of our customers told me something
                 that stopped me cold..."

Question hook:  "How much time did your team spend on [task] last month?"

Stat hook:      "Teams that [do X] are 3x more likely to [achieve Y]."

Direct hook:    "I built something I think you'll find useful."

Empathy hook:   "If you're anything like most [role], [common frustration]
                 is a constant battle."
```

## 4.2 Body Patterns

### The One-Idea Email

```
Hook (1-2 sentences)
Main point (2-3 short paragraphs)
CTA (1 sentence + button or link)
```

### The List Email

```
Hook (1-2 sentences)
Point 1 (2-3 sentences)
Point 2 (2-3 sentences)
Point 3 (2-3 sentences)
CTA (1 sentence + button or link)
```

### The Story Email

```
Setup (1-2 sentences: who and what situation)
Tension (2-3 sentences: the problem or challenge)
Resolution (2-3 sentences: what happened)
Lesson (1-2 sentences: the takeaway)
CTA (1 sentence: how this relates to the reader)
```

## 4.3 CTA Placement

### Single CTA Rule

Every email has one primary CTA. It should appear:

- Once in the body (linked text or button)
- Optionally repeated at the end

```
For short emails (under 150 words): CTA at the end
For medium emails (150-300 words): CTA after the main point
For long emails (300+ words): CTA after the main point AND at the end
```

### CTA Formatting

```
Strong:   Standalone button with action + value text
          [Start Your Free Trial]

Good:     Linked text in a sentence
          "You can start your free trial here."

Weak:     Raw URL
          "https://example.com/signup"
```

## 4.4 The PS Line

The PS line is one of the most-read elements in an email. Use it for:

```
- Repeating the main CTA in different words
- Adding a bonus or incentive
- Creating urgency
- Sharing a personal note

Example:
"P.S. The 20% discount expires Friday. After that, it's full price."

Example:
"P.S. If you have questions, just reply to this email.
I read every response."
```

# Part 5: Timing and Cadence

## 5.1 Sequence Spacing Patterns

### Welcome Sequence Spacing

```
Email 1:  Immediately after signup
Email 2:  1-2 days later
Email 3:  2-3 days later
Email 4:  2-3 days later
Email 5:  3-4 days later
Email 6:  3-4 days later
Email 7:  3-4 days later
```

Tighter spacing early (when interest is highest), wider spacing as the sequence progresses.

### Nurture Sequence Spacing

```
Email 1:  Immediately (resource delivery)
Email 2:  2-3 days later
Email 3:  3-4 days later
Email 4:  4-5 days later
...gradually spacing out to weekly
```

### General Rule

Never send more than one email per day in an automated sequence. Leave at least 24 hours between sends. For ongoing newsletters, once per week is the safest frequency.

## 5.2 Send-Time Guidance

### B2B Emails

```
Best days:    Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Best times:   9-10 AM and 1-2 PM in the recipient's timezone
Avoid:        Monday morning, Friday afternoon, weekends
```

### B2C Emails

```
Best days:    Varies by audience; test aggressively
Best times:   10 AM, 2 PM, or 8 PM in the recipient's timezone
Weekend:      Acceptable for B2C; may perform well
```

### Important Note

These are starting points, not rules. Every audience is different. Use send-time optimization features if your platform supports them, and A/B test timing for your specific list.

## 5.3 Frequency Guidelines

```
Segment                    Maximum Frequency
-------                    -----------------
Active engaged             2-3 emails per week
Moderately engaged         1 email per week
Low engagement             1 email per 2 weeks
Re-engagement segment      1 email per 3-5 days (short sequence only)
```

When in doubt, send less. An unsubscribe is permanent. A skipped email is recoverable.

---

# Part 6: Segmentation

## 6.1 Behavioral Segmentation

Segment based on what people have done.

```
Segment                    Criteria                       Use Case
-------                    --------                       --------
Resource downloaders       Downloaded specific resource   Nurture on that topic
Webinar attendees          Attended a webinar             Follow up with related content
Page visitors              Visited pricing page           Send pricing-focused email
Trial users                Started a trial                Onboarding sequence
Feature users              Used specific feature          Advanced tips for that feature
Cart abandoners            Added item, didn't purchase    Recovery sequence
```

## 6.2 Demographic Segmentation

Segment based on who people are.

```
Segment                    Criteria                       Use Case
-------                    --------                       --------
By role                    Job title / function           Role-specific content
By company size            Employee count / revenue       Use case alignment
By industry                Vertical / sector              Industry-specific examples
By geography               Country / timezone             Localized content and timing
```

## 6.3 Engagement-Based Segmentation

Segment based on email interaction.

```
Segment           Criteria                          Action
-------           --------                          ------
Highly engaged    Opened 5+ of last 10 emails       Increase frequency, send offers
Engaged           Opened 2-4 of last 10 emails      Maintain current frequency
Low engagement    Opened 0-1 of last 10 emails      Decrease frequency, test subject lines
Unengaged         No open in 60+ days                Re-engagement sequence, then suppress
```

## 6.4 Lifecycle Stage Segmentation

```
Stage              Description                     Email Strategy
-----              -----------                     --------------
Subscriber         Email only, no account          Welcome + nurture
Lead               Showed buying intent            Educational + offer
Trial user         Active trial                    Onboarding + conversion
Customer           Paying customer                 Retention + expansion
Churned            Former customer                 Win-back sequence
Advocate           Active promoter                 Referral + community
```

# Part 7: Deliverability

Your emails cannot convert if they do not reach the inbox. Deliverability is the prerequisite for everything else.

## 7.1 Authentication

### Required Records

```
SPF  (Sender Policy Framework):
  - Specifies which servers can send email for your domain
  - Add your ESP's include directive to your DNS

DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):
  - Cryptographic signature proving the email is from your domain
  - Configured via DNS TXT records provided by your ESP

DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication):
  - Policy telling receivers what to do with unauthenticated email
  - Start with p=none (monitoring), move to p=quarantine, then p=reject
```

### Verification Checklist

```
[ ] SPF record is set up and includes your ESP
[ ] DKIM is configured and passing
[ ] DMARC is set up (at least p=none to start)
[ ] Return-path aligns with your sending domain
[ ] Custom sending domain is configured (not ESP's default domain)
```

## 7.2 Avoiding Spam Triggers

### Content Triggers

```
Avoid:
- ALL CAPS in subject lines or body
- Excessive exclamation marks
- Spam trigger phrases: "Buy now", "Act now", "Free offer", "Click below"
- Image-only emails (low text-to-image ratio)
- Misleading subject lines (subject must match content)
- URL shorteners (use full URLs)
- Too many links in a single email

Prefer:
- Plain text or minimal HTML
- Recognizable "From" name (person name or brand name)
- Consistent sending domain
- Clear unsubscribe link
- Physical mailing address in footer (required by law)
```

### Technical Triggers

```
Avoid:
- Sending from a new domain without warming
- Sudden volume spikes (10x normal send volume)
- High bounce rates (over 2%)
- Low engagement rates signaling to ISPs
- Sending to purchased or scraped lists

Maintain:
- Bounce rate under 2%
- Spam complaint rate under 0.1%
- Consistent sending volume and schedule
```

## 7.3 List Hygiene

### Regular Maintenance

```
Frequency      Action
---------      ------
Every send     Remove hard bounces immediately
Monthly        Review soft bounces (remove after 3 consecutive)
Quarterly      Suppress unengaged contacts (no open in 90 days)
Annually       Full list audit and re-permission campaign
```

### Sunsetting Policy

Contacts who have not engaged in 90+ days should be moved through:

1. Re-engagement sequence (3-5 emails)
2. If no engagement: suppress from active sends
3. After 180 days: remove from list

Smaller, engaged lists outperform larger, disengaged lists on every metric.

## 7.4 Domain Warming

When using a new sending domain or IP:

```
Week 1:    50-100 emails/day to most engaged contacts
Week 2:    200-500 emails/day
Week 3:    500-1,000 emails/day
Week 4:    1,000-5,000 emails/day
Week 5+:   Gradually increase to full volume

Key rules:
- Send to most engaged contacts first
- Monitor bounce rates and spam complaints daily
- If metrics degrade, reduce volume and investigate
- Never rush the warming process
```

# Part 8: Metrics and Benchmarks

## 8.1 Key Metrics

```
Metric              Definition                          Benchmark Range
------              ----------                          ---------------
Open rate           Unique opens / delivered             20-40% (varies by industry)
Click rate          Unique clicks / delivered            2-5%
Click-to-open       Unique clicks / unique opens         10-15%
Conversion rate     Conversions / delivered              1-3%
Bounce rate         Bounces / sent                       Under 2%
Unsubscribe rate    Unsubs / delivered                   Under 0.5%
Spam complaint      Complaints / delivered               Under 0.1%
List growth rate    (New - unsubs - bounces) / total     Positive month over month
```

### Important Note on Open Rates

Apple Mail Privacy Protection and similar features inflate open rates. Treat open rates as directional, not exact. Click rate and conversion rate are more reliable.

## 8.2 Diagnostic Framework

```
Problem                 Likely Cause                    Fix
-------                 -----------                     ---
Low open rate           Weak subject line               A/B test subject lines
                        Poor sender reputation          Check authentication, warm domain
                        Wrong send time                 Test different times

Low click rate          Weak CTA                        Improve CTA copy and placement
                        Irrelevant content              Improve segmentation
                        Too many CTAs                   Reduce to one primary CTA

High unsubscribe        Too frequent                    Reduce frequency
                        Irrelevant content              Improve segmentation
                        Broken expectations             Align content with signup promise

High bounce rate        Stale list                      Clean list, remove old contacts
                        Bad data source                 Audit lead sources
                        Technical issue                 Check authentication records

Low conversion          Misaligned landing page         Match email promise to landing page
                        Weak offer                      Improve the offer
                        Wrong audience                  Review segmentation
