# Part 1: Content Pillar Framework

## 1.1 Defining Pillars

Content pillars are 3-5 core topics that align with your expertise, audience interests, and business goals. Every post should fit within a pillar. If it does not, it does not get published.

### How to Define Pillars

```
Step 1: List your areas of expertise (what you know deeply)
Step 2: List your audience's interests (what they care about)
Step 3: List your business goals (what drives revenue)
Step 4: Find the overlap -- those are your pillars
```

### Example Pillar Set

```
Pillar                  Description
------                  -----------
Industry Insights       Trends, news, analysis of the market
How-To / Educational    Tutorials, frameworks, actionable advice
Behind the Scenes       Process, team, decision-making, culture
Customer Stories        Case studies, results, testimonials
Product / Promotional   Features, launches, offers
```

### Pillar Validation

Each pillar must pass three tests:

1. **Depth**: Can you create 50+ unique posts on this topic?
2. **Relevance**: Does your target audience care about this topic?
3. **Authority**: Are you credible enough to speak on this topic?

## 1.2 Content Mix Ratios

Not all pillars get equal airtime. Use ratios to balance value-giving content with promotional content.

### Recommended Ratios

```
Educational / How-To:     40%
Engagement / Discussion:  30%
Promotional / Product:    20%
Entertainment / Culture:  10%
```

### Ratio Adjustment by Stage

```
Brand Stage              Educational   Engagement   Promotional   Entertainment
-----------              -----------   ----------   -----------   -------------
Pre-launch               50%           30%          10%           10%
Growth                   40%           30%          20%           10%
Established              30%           30%          25%           15%
```

Increase educational content when building awareness. Increase promotional content when launching or scaling.

## 1.3 Pillar-to-Platform Mapping

Not every pillar works equally well on every platform.

```
Pillar              LinkedIn    Twitter/X    Instagram    TikTok
------              --------    ---------    ---------    ------
Industry Insights   Strong      Strong       Weak         Weak
How-To              Strong      Good         Good         Strong
Behind the Scenes   Good        Good         Strong       Strong
Customer Stories    Strong      Good         Good         Good
Promotional         Good        Good         Strong       Good
```

Focus each platform on the pillars where it performs best. Do not force content that does not fit the medium.

# Part 2: Hook Formulas

The first line (or first 3 seconds for video) determines whether anyone engages. Hooks are not clickbait -- they are honest opening statements that earn attention.

## 2.1 Pattern Interrupt Hooks

Break the expected pattern in the feed. Surprise, challenge, or contradict expectations.

```
"I got fired for doing this. It turned out to be the best thing
 that happened to my career."

"We deleted our most popular feature. Revenue went up."

"The worst marketing advice I ever received came from a
 Fortune 500 CMO."
```

## 2.2 Question Hooks

Ask a question the reader wants to answer or have answered.

```
"What would you do if your biggest customer left tomorrow?"

"How many hours per week does your team spend on [common task]?"

"If you could only keep one marketing channel, which would it be?"
```

Questions work best when:
- The reader can immediately picture their own answer
- The question implies a non-obvious answer is coming
- It is specific enough to feel relevant (not generic)

## 2.3 Data and Stat Hooks

Lead with a specific, surprising number.

```
"Teams that [do X] are 3.2x more likely to [achieve Y]."

"We analyzed 10,000 landing pages. Only 12% had this one element."

"The average [role] spends 23 hours per month on [task].
 Here's how to cut that in half."
```

Rules for stat hooks:
- The number must be specific (not "many" or "most")
- The source must be real (never fabricate data)
- The implication must matter to the audience

## 2.4 Story Hooks

Open with a specific moment in time. Stories are inherently engaging because the reader wants to know what happens next.

```
"Last Tuesday, a customer sent me a 3-paragraph email that changed
 how I think about onboarding."

"Two years ago, we had 12 customers and zero revenue. Here's what
 we did next."

"I was halfway through a demo when the prospect said something
 I'll never forget."
```

### Story Hook Formula

```
[Time marker] + [specific situation] + [emotional signal or tension]
```

## 2.5 Contrarian Hooks

Take a position that goes against conventional wisdom. Only use when you can back it up with reasoning or evidence.

```
"Unpopular opinion: landing pages are overrated."

"Everyone says you should post every day. I disagree.
 Here's why."

"Stop A/B testing your headlines. Do this instead."
```

### Contrarian Hook Rules

1. Only take a contrarian stance you genuinely believe
2. Follow up with reasoning, not just the hot take
3. Acknowledge the conventional view respectfully
4. Provide an alternative, not just criticism

## 2.6 Curiosity Gap Hooks

Create an information gap that can only be closed by reading the rest.

```
"There's one thing every successful campaign has in common.
 It's not what you think."

"I spent $50,000 on ads before I figured out this one principle."

"The #1 reason landing pages fail has nothing to do with copy."
```

Important: the payoff must match the hook. If the hook creates high expectations and the content is generic, trust is destroyed.

# Part 3: Platform-Specific Guidance

## 3.1 LinkedIn

### Format and Tone

```
Tone:           Professional but conversational. First person.
Post length:    800-1,300 characters for feed posts (longer posts
                get clipped behind "...see more")
Best formats:   Text posts, carousels (PDF documents), polls,
                native articles
Posting freq:   3-5 times per week
Best times:     Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM or 12-1 PM
```

### LinkedIn Post Structure

```
Line 1:    Hook (the first line visible without expanding)
Line 2:    [blank line]
Lines 3-8: Body (short paragraphs, 1-2 sentences each)
Line 9:    [blank line]
Line 10:   Takeaway or CTA
Line 11:   [blank line]
Line 12:   Hashtags (3-5 maximum)
```

### LinkedIn Best Practices

```
DO:
- Start with a strong first line (it determines engagement)
- Use line breaks generously (walls of text get scrolled past)
- Ask a question at the end to drive comments
- Tag specific people when relevant (not mass-tagging)
- Respond to every comment within 1-2 hours of posting

DON'T:
- Use more than 5 hashtags
- Share external links in the post body (LinkedIn suppresses reach)
- Post and leave (engagement requires your active participation)
- Cross-post identical content from other platforms
```

### LinkedIn Carousel Format

Carousels (PDF documents uploaded as posts) consistently outperform text posts for educational content.

```
Slide 1:    Title slide with hook (treat as the thumbnail)
Slide 2:    Problem statement or context
Slides 3-8: One point per slide, large text, minimal design
Slide 9:    Summary / recap
Slide 10:   CTA (follow, save, share, or visit link)

Design rules:
- Square format (1080x1080) or portrait (1080x1350)
- Large text readable on mobile (24pt minimum for body text)
- Consistent brand colors and fonts across all slides
- One core idea per slide
```

## 3.2 Twitter/X

### Format and Tone

```
Tone:           Direct, concise, conversational. Personality-forward.
Post length:    Under 280 characters for single tweets.
                Threads for longer content (3-10 tweets).
Best formats:   Single tweets, threads, quote tweets, polls
Posting freq:   1-5 times per day (including replies and engagement)
Best times:     Weekdays, 9-11 AM or 1-3 PM. Test for your audience.
```

### Single Tweet Structures

```
Hot take:
"[Contrarian opinion]. Here's why: [one-sentence reason]."

Observation:
"I noticed that [pattern]. The best teams [do X] instead of [Y]."

Tip:
"[Audience] tip: [specific actionable advice in one sentence]."

Result:
"We [did X]. Result: [specific outcome]. Here's the takeaway: [lesson]."
```

### Thread Structure

```
Tweet 1:   Hook + promise ("Here are 7 things I learned...")
Tweet 2:   Point 1 (the strongest or most surprising)
Tweet 3:   Point 2
...
Tweet N-1: Final point
Tweet N:   Recap + CTA ("Follow for more" or "Bookmark this thread")
```

### Thread Rules

- The first tweet must work as a standalone piece of content
- Each tweet should make sense on its own (some people see them individually)
- Number the points ("1/", "2/" or use numbered lists)
- End with a CTA and a self-reply linking back to tweet 1

## 3.3 Instagram

### Format and Tone

```
Tone:           Visual-first. Captions can be conversational or educational.
Caption length: 100-300 words for educational content.
                1-3 sentences for aesthetic/brand content.
Best formats:   Carousels, Reels, Stories, static images
Posting freq:   3-5 feed posts per week + daily Stories
Best times:     Varies widely. Test for your audience.
```

### Instagram Post Types

```
Type              Best For                       Engagement Level
----              --------                       ----------------
Carousel          Educational content, lists      Highest
Reel              Discovery, trending topics      High (best for reach)
Single image      Quotes, announcements           Medium
Stories           Daily updates, polls, Q&A       Medium (but builds habit)
```

### Instagram Caption Structure

```
Line 1:    Hook (first line visible before "...more")
Line 2:    [blank line]
Lines 3-6: Body (educational content or story)
Line 7:    [blank line]
Line 8:    CTA ("Save this for later", "Share with a friend",
           "Drop a [emoji] if you agree")
Line 9:    [blank line]
Line 10:   Hashtags (15-20, mix of sizes)
```

### Instagram Reels Strategy

```
Structure (15-60 seconds):
0-3 sec:    Hook (text overlay or verbal)
3-15 sec:   Setup/context
15-45 sec:  Value delivery
45-60 sec:  CTA or takeaway

Production rules:
- Vertical format (9:16)
- Native-looking (not overly produced)
- Captions/text overlays required (most watch without sound)
- Trending audio can boost discovery when relevant
- First frame is the thumbnail (make it count)
```

## 3.4 TikTok

### Format and Tone

```
Tone:           Authentic, personality-driven, trend-aware.
                Professional polish works against you on TikTok.
Video length:   15-60 seconds (under 30 seconds performs best)
Best formats:   Short video, native editing, trending sounds
Posting freq:   1-3 times per day for growth, 3-5 per week minimum
Best times:     Test heavily. TikTok audiences vary.
```

### TikTok Video Structure

```
0-3 sec:    Hook (pattern interrupt, question, bold statement)
3-10 sec:   Context (why this matters)
10-25 sec:  Value (the actual content)
25-30 sec:  CTA or callback to hook

Critical rule: If you lose them in the first 3 seconds, the algorithm
buries the video. The hook is everything.
```

### TikTok Content Rules

```
DO:
- Look directly at the camera
- Use trending sounds when they fit naturally
- Add text overlays (most viewers watch without sound)
- Be conversational, not scripted
- Follow the "teach one thing" format for business content
- Use native editing tools (stitch, duet, green screen)

DON'T:
- Repurpose polished corporate video
- Use hard-sell language
- Ignore comments (engagement drives the algorithm)
- Post content that feels like an ad
- Ignore trends entirely (trend awareness matters)
```

# Part 4: Content Repurposing Workflow

## 4.1 The Repurposing Chain

Every piece of long-form content should generate multiple social posts across platforms. This maximizes the return on content creation effort.

### The Chain

```
Long-form content (blog post, podcast, video, webinar)
    |
    +-- 3-5 key insights extracted
    |
    +-- Each insight becomes:
        |
        +-- 1 LinkedIn post (text or carousel)
        +-- 1-2 tweets or a thread
        +-- 1 Instagram carousel or Reel
        +-- 1 TikTok video (if applicable)
        +-- 1 email section or standalone email
```

### Example

Blog post: "7 Mistakes Teams Make When Scaling Their Deploy Process"

```
LinkedIn:   Long-form post on mistake #1 (the most surprising one)
            Carousel covering all 7 mistakes
Thread:     Twitter thread covering all 7 with one tweet per mistake
Instagram:  Carousel with one mistake per slide
Reel:       30-second video on the single biggest mistake
TikTok:     15-second "The #1 mistake teams make when scaling deploys"
Email:      Newsletter section linking to the full post
```

## 4.2 Format Adaptation Rules

Do not copy-paste across platforms. Adapt the content to fit each platform's native format.

```
Platform      Adaptation
--------      ----------
LinkedIn      Add professional context, relate to career/business outcomes
Twitter/X     Compress to the essential insight, make it punchy
Instagram     Lead with visual, use carousel for step-by-step
TikTok        Lead with hook, one key insight, conversational delivery
Email         Add personal angle, link to full content
```

### The 3-Pass Method

```
Pass 1: Extract the core insight (1-2 sentences)
Pass 2: Adapt to the platform format and constraints
Pass 3: Add a platform-native hook and CTA
```

## 4.3 Evergreen Recycling

Content that performed well can be reposted with modifications.

```
Recycling schedule:
- Wait at least 30 days before reposting similar content
- Change the hook (different angle on the same topic)
- Update data or examples if available
- Adjust format (if the original was text, try a carousel)
```

### What to Recycle

```
Recycle:                         Don't recycle:
--------                         ---------------
Evergreen educational content    Time-sensitive announcements
Frameworks and how-to posts      News commentary
Data-driven insights             Trend-based content
Customer stories (with updates)  One-time events
```

# Part 5: Content Calendar Structure

## 5.1 Weekly Planning Template

```
Day         Content Type              Platform Priority
---         ------------              -----------------
Monday      Industry insight          LinkedIn, Twitter
Tuesday     Educational / How-To      LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok
Wednesday   Engagement / Discussion   Twitter, LinkedIn
Thursday    Behind the scenes         Instagram, TikTok
Friday      Customer story or promo   LinkedIn, Instagram
Weekend     Lighter / personal        Instagram Stories, TikTok
```

This is a starting template. Adjust based on platform performance data.

## 5.2 Monthly Themes

Organize each month around a theme that ties content together across platforms.

```
Month       Theme                     Content Focus
-----       -----                     -------------
January     Planning & goal-setting   Frameworks, templates, planning guides
February    Optimization              Improvement tips, benchmark data
March       Growth                    Scaling strategies, case studies
...
```

### Theme Benefits

- Provides creative direction for content batching
- Creates a coherent narrative across platforms
- Allows deeper exploration of topics
- Simplifies content planning decisions

## 5.3 Batching Workflow

Create all content for the week in a single session rather than daily.

```
Step 1: Review pillar topics and monthly theme (5 min)
Step 2: Draft 5-7 posts across platforms (60-90 min)
Step 3: Create visuals or schedule video recording (30-60 min)
Step 4: Schedule posts using scheduling tool (15 min)
Step 5: Prepare engagement prompts and follow-up comments (10 min)

Total: 2-3 hours covers an entire week of social content.
```

### Batch Day Structure

```
Block 1 (60 min): Write all text-based posts
Block 2 (45 min): Create carousels, images, or record videos
Block 3 (15 min): Schedule everything
Block 4 (10 min): Pre-write engagement responses
```

---

# Part 6: Engagement Strategy

Posting is only half of social media. Engagement determines whether the algorithm amplifies your content and whether followers become advocates.

## 6.1 Community Building

### Daily Engagement Routine (30 minutes)

```
First 10 min:  Respond to all comments on your posts
Next 10 min:   Comment meaningfully on 5-10 posts from:
               - Target customers
               - Industry peers
               - Complementary brands
Final 10 min:  Engage with people who shared your content
               DM new followers or commenters (when appropriate)
```

### What "Meaningful Engagement" Means

```
Bad:    "Great post!"
Bad:    "[fire emoji] [clap emoji]"
Good:   "This mirrors what we saw with [specific example].
         One thing I'd add is [insight]."
Good:   "We tried this approach last quarter. The part about
         [specific point] made the biggest difference for us."
```

Add value to the conversation. Share a perspective, ask a follow-up question, or add a relevant example.

## 6.2 Response Patterns

### When to Respond

```
Every comment on your posts:    Respond within 1-2 hours of posting
                                (this is when the algorithm evaluates engagement)
Questions:                      Respond within 4 hours
Complaints or criticism:        Respond within 1 hour (see below)
Mentions and tags:              Respond within 24 hours
DMs:                            Respond within 24 hours
```

### Handling Negative Feedback

```
Step 1: Acknowledge the concern ("I hear you on that")
Step 2: Respond to the substance, not the tone
Step 3: If warranted, offer to continue the conversation in DMs
Step 4: Do not delete negative comments unless they are spam or abusive
Step 5: Do not argue. State your perspective once, then move on.
```

### Boosting Engagement Through Responses

Reply to comments with follow-up questions to create conversation threads. Multi-turn conversations signal high-quality content to algorithms.

```
Comment: "This is exactly what our team experienced."
Reply:   "What ended up working for you? We found that [X] made
          the biggest difference."
```

## 6.3 User-Generated Content

UGC builds trust and community. Make it easy for customers to create content about your product.

### Encouraging UGC

```
Strategy                        Example
--------                        -------
Feature customers publicly      "Spotlight: How [Customer] uses [Product]"
Create shareable templates      Branded templates users can customize
Run challenges                  "Show us your [workflow/setup/results]"
Reshare and credit              Repost customer content with attribution
Ask directly                    "Would you be open to sharing your story?"
```

### UGC Usage Rules

1. Always ask permission before reposting
2. Always credit the original creator
3. Do not alter the content without permission
4. Thank creators publicly and privately

---

# Part 7: Hashtag Strategy

## 7.1 Hashtag Types

```
Type          Description                     Example
----          -----------                     -------
Branded       Unique to your brand            #YourBrandName
Niche         Specific to your industry       #SaaSMarketing
Community     Used by your target audience    #MarketingTwitter
Trending      Currently popular               [varies]
Descriptive   Describes the content type      #MarketingTips
```

### Hashtag Research Process

```
Step 1: Search your niche terms on each platform
Step 2: Note which hashtags top creators in your space use
Step 3: Check hashtag volume (too small = no discovery,
        too large = buried instantly)
Step 4: Build a list of 30-50 hashtags across all types
Step 5: Rotate sets of hashtags across posts
```

## 7.2 Platform-Specific Hashtag Rules

### LinkedIn

```
Quantity:    3-5 hashtags per post
Placement:  At the end of the post, on their own line
Strategy:   Mix 1-2 broad (#Marketing) with 2-3 niche (#B2BSaaS)
Tip:        LinkedIn hashtags are less impactful than on other platforms.
            Prioritize content quality over hashtag optimization.
```

### Twitter/X

```
Quantity:    1-2 hashtags per tweet, or none
Placement:  Inline or at the end
Strategy:   Only use hashtags that add context. On Twitter, hashtags
            can feel spammy. When in doubt, leave them out.
Tip:        Hashtags matter more for events and live conversations
            than for regular content.
```

### Instagram

```
Quantity:    15-20 hashtags per post
Placement:  In the caption (after the CTA) or in first comment
Strategy:   Mix sizes -- 5 large (1M+), 5 medium (100K-1M),
            5 small (10K-100K), 5 niche (under 10K)
Tip:        Rotate hashtag sets to avoid being flagged as spam.
            Track which sets drive the most discovery.
```

### TikTok

```
Quantity:    3-5 hashtags per video
Placement:  In the video description
Strategy:   1-2 trending hashtags + 2-3 niche hashtags
Tip:        TikTok hashtags signal content category to the algorithm.
            Use them to tell TikTok who should see your content.
```
